[[anchor-3]]**Introduction**

[[anchor-4]]Throughout this document we make use of terminology for which the specific meaning has great importance for overall understanding, especially for terms that might differ from, or vary in common usage. We mark these key words in **bold, **with a link to the glossary, to call attention to the specific meaning and avoid potential confusion. All terms so marked are defined in the <<__*Glossary*__>>.

[[anchor-5]]This publication provides guidelines to the best practice for ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤. Though it is targeted specifically at biological occurrence data, the concepts and methods presented here can be applied in other disciplines where spatial interpretation of ¤<<location>>¤ is of interest. This document builds on the original _*Guide to Best Practices for Georeferencing *_(Chapman & Wieczorek 2006), which was one of the outputs from the BioGeomancer project (Guralnick __et al. __2006). Several earlier projects (MaNIS, MaPSTeDI, INRAM, GEOLocate, NatureServe, CRIA, ERIN, CONABIO, etc.) had previously developed guidelines and tools for ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤, and these provided a good starting point for such a document. A detailed history of the organizations involved in the development of BioGeomancer and of the original _*Guide*_ was given in that source. Throughout this document we reference tools and methodologies developed by those organizations and we acknowledge the valuable work by those organizations in their development. This document attempts to bring best practices up to date with terms, technologies, and ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ recommendations that have been developed and refined since the original document was published.

This document is designed so that institutions with ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ commitments can extract those portions that apply to their own requirements and priorities, and adapt them if necessary where those practices vary from, or elaborate on, the ones given here. Derived works should be made publicly accessible and the derived ¤<<georeferencing protocol>>¤ should be cited in the metadata of any ¤<<georeference,georeferenced>>¤ records that were produced by it. Citing a published protocol when your own methods differ would violate the best practice principle of replicability, described in <<__*1.5 Principles of Best Practice>>*. __An example of a citable protocol is the _*Georeferencing Quick Reference Guide*_ (Zermoglio et al., 2020). This document should not be cited as a ¤<<georeferencing protocol>>¤.

This version is a complete revision with many new and updated references. The major changes and additions in this edition include:

* Redefined the term ¤<<extent>>¤ to conform with general English and common technical usage to mean a distance, area or volume within defined ¤<<boundary,boundaries>>¤ and added the term ¤<<radial>>¤ to cover the sense of the term "extent" in previous documents (Wieczorek 2001, Wieczorek _et al_. 2004, Chapman & Wieczorek 2006, Wieczorek _et al_. 2012a, Wieczorek & Bloom 2015).
* introduced the concept of the ¤<<corrected center>>¤ to replace ¤<<geographic center>>¤ wherever that was used in the past. This is an important change because the ¤<<geographic center>>¤ did not necessarily yield the correct minimum ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ due to the ¤<<extent>>¤ of a feature, the ¤<<corrected center>>¤ does.
* Expanded the sections on ¤<<elevation>>¤ and updated them to provide the most recent information on recording ¤<<elevation>>¤ and of determining ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ due to ¤<<accuracy>>¤ of ¤<<GPS>>¤s and ¤<<DEM>>¤s.
* Expanded information on ¤<<GPS>>¤ satellites to include information on the other ¤<<GNSS>>¤ satellite systems.
* Added information on the use of smartphones and cameras to record ¤<<GPS>>¤ locations and elevations.
* Elaborated on the ¤<<shape>> <<georeferencing method>>¤, including steps to refine the ¤<<point-radius>> <<georeferencing method>>¤.
* Expanded the explanations to include ecological, marine and other data collected in ¤<<transect,transects>>¤, along irregular ¤<<path,paths>>¤, in polygons, or on <<grid,*grids>>.*
* Added information on determining ¤<<georeference,georeferences>>¤ for subterranean locations such as caves, tunnels and mine sites.
* Added information on ¤<<bathymetry>>¤ and underwater ¤<<depth,depths>>¤.
* Integrated this document with the companion documents _*Georeferencing Quick Reference Guide*_ (Zermoglio _et al._ 2020) and _*Georeferencing Calculator Manual*_ (Bloom _et al_. 2020).

[[anchor-6]]1.1 Objectives

This document aims to provide current best practice for using the ¤<<point-radius>>¤,* <<bounding box>>,* and ¤<<shape>>¤ <<georeferencing method,**georeferencing**__* *__*methods>>*, whether for new records in the field or for retrospective ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ of historic and un-georeferenced ¤<<location,locations>>¤. We hope that the reader will come away from this document with, if nothing else, a good appreciation of the following essential principles:

* No matter how specific a ¤<<location>>¤ might seem, every ¤<<location>>¤ has an associated ¤<<uncertainty>>¤, and this ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ determines the conditions under which the spatial interpretation of the ¤<<location>>¤ can be used. Based on this, ¤<<coordinates>>¤ without a carefully determined ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ should not be considered a ¤<<georeference>>¤, they should be considered ¤<<coordinates>>¤ whose meaning is not clear.
* Interpretations of ¤<<location,locations>>¤ are fraught with a wide variety of sources of ¤<<uncertainty>>¤, and these are not always trivial to aggregate into an overall ¤<<uncertainty>>¤.
* The best ¤<<locality>>¤ description is one that is specific, concise, complete, and unambiguous; the more detailed the description, the better the chance of getting a ¤<<georeference>>¤ that is reproducible and that minimizes the ¤<<uncertainty>>¤.
* ¤<<coordinate precision,Coordinate precision>>¤ is not the same as ¤<<coordinate uncertainty>>¤, it is just one of many factors contributing to the overall ¤<<uncertainty>>¤.
* Users of ¤<<georeference,georeferences>>¤ should take into account the ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ (or lack of its documentation) when choosing data for analyses, as without that information, analyses may be skewed and results ¤<<bias,biased>>¤ or altogether wrong.
* ¤<<coordinates,Coordinates>>¤ alone can not generally be checked for consistency; a ¤<<locality>>¤ description provides a confirmation that ¤<<coordinates>>¤ are correct.
* ¤<<coordinates,Coordinates>>¤ alone do not unambiguously define a ¤<<location>>¤, because:
** *<<coordinates>>* require a ¤<<coordinate reference system>>¤ to anchor the ¤<<coordinates>>¤ in relation to the earth

** no ¤<<location>>¤ is a point; even the most specific ¤<<location,locations>>¤ have an ¤<<extent>>¤

** any device that provides ¤<<coordinates>>¤ has an associated ¤<<uncertainty>>¤



*Conclusion*: ¤<<coordinates>>¤ alone do not constitute a ¤<<georeference>>¤.


* ¤<<geometry,Geometries>>¤ are great as ¤<<georeference,georeferences>>¤, if you can deal with them; if not, the ¤<<point-radius>>¤ is surprisingly powerful, because using a ¤<<geographic information system,Geographic Information System>>¤ (GIS), it can be intersected with other spatial layers to get ¤<<geometry,geometries>>¤ (¤<<shape,shapes>>¤).

[[anchor-7]]1.2 Target Audience

This work is designed for those who need, or want to know **why** the best practices are what they are, in detail. This document is also for individuals or organizations faced with planning a ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ project by providing a series of questions that suggests particular subsets of the best practices to follow.

[[anchor-8]]For those who just need to know how to put these practices into action while ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤, the __*Georeferencing *__Q_*uick Reference Guide*_ (Zermoglio _et al._ 2020) is the most suitable document to have at hand. The __*Georeferencing *__Q_*uick Reference Guide*_ refers to details in this document as needed and accompanies the __*Georeferencing *__C_*alculator*_ (Wieczorek & Wieczorek 2020), which is a tool to calculate ¤<<coordinates>>¤ and ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ following the methods described in this document.

[[anchor-9]]Above all, this document will help data end users to understand the implications of trying to use records that have not undergone ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ best practices and the value of those that have.

[[anchor-10]]1.3 Scope

This document is one of three that cover recommended requirements and methods to ¤<<georeference>>¤ ¤<<location,locations>>¤. It is meant to cover the theoretical aspects (how to, and why) of spatially enabling information about the ¤<<location>>¤ of biodiversity-related phenomena, including special consideration for ecological and marine data. It also covers approaches to large-scale and collaborative ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ projects.

These documents DO NOT provide guidance on georectifying images or ¤<<geocode,geocoding>>¤ street addresses.

The accompanying __*Georeferencing *__Q_*uick Reference Guide*_ (Zermoglio _et al._ 2020) provides a practical how-to guide for putting the theory of the ¤<<shape>>¤,* <<bounding box>>*, and ¤<<point-radius>>¤ ¤<<georeferencing method,georeferencing methods>>¤ into practice. The __*Georeferencing *__Q_*uick Reference Guide*_ relies on this document for background, definitions, more detailed explanations, and information on dealing with a wide variety of specific cases (see <<__*3.4.8 Using the Georeferencing Quick Reference Guide*__>>

The __*Georeferencing *__C_*alculator*_ (Wieczorek & Wieczorek 2020) is a browser-based javascript application that aids in ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ descriptive ¤<<locality,localities>>¤ and provides methods to help obtain ¤<<geographic coordinates>>¤ and ¤<<uncertainty,uncertainties>>¤ for ¤<<location,locations>>¤ (see <<__*3.4.9 Using the Georeferencing Calculator*__>>

[[anchor-11]]1.4 Constraints

Constraints to using this document may arise because of:

* Specimens with labels that are hard to read or decipher.
* Records that don’t contain sufficient information.
* Records that contain conflicting information.
* Historic localities that are hard to find on current maps.
* ¤<<Locality>>¤ names that have changed through time.
* Marine <<location,locations>> from old ships' logs.
* Lack of information on ¤<<datum,datums>>¤ and/or ¤<<coordinate reference system,coordinate reference systems>>¤.
* Data Management Systems that don’t allow for recording or storage of the required ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ information.
* Poor or no internet facilities.
* Lack of access to suitable resources (maps, reliable ¤<<gazetteer,gazetteers>>¤, etc.).
* Lack of institutional/supervisor support.
* Lack of training.

[[anchor-12]]1.5 Principles of Best Practice

The following are principles of best practice that should be applied to ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤:

* ¤<<accuracy,Accuracy>>¤ – a measure of how well the data represent the truth, for example, how well is the true ¤<<location>>¤ of the target of an observation, collecting, or sampling ¤<<event>>¤ represented in a ¤<<georeference>>¤. This includes considerations taken both at the moment when the location was recorded and when it was ¤<<georeference,georeferenced>>¤. Note that careless lack of ¤<<precision>>¤ will have an adverse effect on ¤<<accuracy>>¤ (see <<__*1.6 Accuracy, Error, Bias, Precision, False Precision, and Uncertainty>>*__).
* *Effectiveness* – the likelihood that a work program achieves its desired objectives. For example, the percentage of records for which the ¤<<coordinates>>¤ and ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ can be ¤<<accuracy,accurately>>¤ identified and calculated (see <<__*6.8 Index of Spatial Uncertainty*__>>).
* *Efficiency* – the relative effort needed to produce an acceptable output, including the effort to assemble and use external input data (_e.g._, ¤<<gazetteer,gazetteers>>¤, collectors’ itineraries, etc.).
* *Reliability* – the relative confidence in the repeatability or consistency with which information was produced and recorded. The reliability of sources and methods that can affect the ¤<<accuracy>>¤ of the results.
* *Accessibility* – the relative ease with which users can find and use information in all of the senses supported by FAIR principles (Wilkinson _et al._ 2016) of data being Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.

* *Transparency* – the relative clarity and completeness of the inputs and processes that produced a result. For example, the ¤<<data quality,quality>>¤ of the metadata and documentation of the methodology by which a ¤<<georeference>>¤ was obtained.
* *Timeliness* – relates to the frequency of data collection, its reporting and updates. For example, how often are ¤<<gazetteer,gazetteers>>¤ updated, how long after ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ are the records made available to others, and how regularly are updates/corrections made following feedback.
* *Relevance* – the relative pertinence and usability of the data to meet the needs of potential users in the sense of the principle of "fitness for use" (Chapman 2005a). Relevance is affected by the format of the output and whether the documentation and metadata are accessible to the user.
* *Replicability *– the relative potential for a result to be reproduced. For example, a ¤<<georeference>>¤ following best practices would have sufficient documentation to be repeated using the same inputs and methods.
* *Adaptability* – the potential for data to be reused under changing circumstances or for new purposes. For example, ¤<<georeference,georeferences>>¤ following best practices would have sufficient documentation to be used in analyses for which they were not originally intended.

In addition, an effective best practices document should:

* Align the vision, mission, and strategic plans in an institution to its policies and procedures and gain the support of sponsors and/or top management.
* Use a standard method of writing (writing format) to produce professional policies and procedures.
* Satisfy industry standards.
* Satisfy the scrutiny of management and external/internal auditors.
* Adhere to relevant standards and biodiversity informatics practices.

[[anchor-13]]1.6 Accuracy, Error, Bias, Precision, False Precision, and Uncertainty

There is often confusion around what is meant by ¤<<accuracy>>¤, ¤<<error>>¤, ¤<<bias>>¤, <<**precision>>, <<false precision>>, **and ¤<<uncertainty>>¤. In addition to the following paragraphs, refer to the definitions in the <<__*Glossary>>*__ and Chapman (2005a). All of these concepts are relevant to measurements.

¤<<accuracy,Accuracy>>¤, <<**error>>,** and ¤<<bias>>¤ all relate directly to estimates of true values. The closer a statement (_e.g._, a measurement) is to the true value, the more ¤<<accuracy,accurate>>¤ it is. ¤<<error,Error>>¤ is a measure of <<**accuracy>> - **the difference between an estimated value and the true value. The more ¤<<accuracy,accurate>>¤ an estimate, the smaller the ¤<<error>>¤. ¤<<bias,Bias>>¤ is a measurement of the average systematic ¤<<error>>¤ in a set of measurements. ¤<<bias,Bias>>¤ often indicates a calibration or other systematic problem, and can be used to remove systematic errors from measurements, thus making them more ¤<<accuracy,accurate>>¤.

NOTE: "**__*Because the true value is not known, but only estimated, the <<accuracy>> of the measured quantity is also unknown. Therefore, <<accuracy>> of coordinate information can only be estimated.*__**" (Geodetic Survey Division 1996, FGDC 1998).

**Figure 1. **¤<<Accuracy>>¤ versus ¤<<precision,Precision>>¤. Data may be ¤<<accuracy,accurate>>¤ and ¤<<precision,precise>>¤, ¤<<accuracy,accurate>>¤ and ¤<<precision,imprecise>>¤, ¤<<precision,precise>>¤ but ¤<<accuracy,inaccurate>>¤, or both ¤<<precision,imprecise>>¤ and ¤<<accuracy,inaccurate>>¤. Reproduced with permission from Arturo Ariño (2020).

Whereas ¤<<error>>¤ is an estimate of the difference between a measured value and the truth, ¤<<precision>>¤ is a measurement of the consistency of repeated measurements to each other. ¤<<precision,Precision>>¤ is not the same as ¤<<accuracy>>¤ (see <<Figure 1>>) because measurements can be consistently wrong (have the same ¤<<error>>¤). ¤<<precision,Precise>>¤ measurements of the same target will give similar results, ¤<<accuracy,accurate>>¤ or not. We quantify ¤<<precision>>¤ as how specific a measurement should be to give consistent results. For example, a measuring device might give measurements to five decimal places (_e.g._, 3.14159), while repeated measurements of the same target with the same device are only consistent to four decimal places (_e.g._, 3.1416). We would say the ¤<<precision>>¤ is 0.0001 in the units of the measurement.

¤<<false precision,False precision>>¤ refers to recorded values that have ¤<<precision>>¤ that is unwarranted by the original measurement. This is often an artifact of how data are stored, calculated, represented, or displayed. For example, a user interface might be designed to always display ¤<<coordinates>>¤ with five decimal places (_e.g._, 3.00000), demonstrating ¤<<false precision>>¤ for any ¤<<coordinates,coordinate>>¤ that was not ¤<<precision,precise>>¤ (_e.g._, 3°, a ¤<<latitude>>¤ given only to the nearest degree). Because ¤<<false precision>>¤ can be undetectable, the actual ¤<<precision>>¤ of a measurement is something that should be captured explicitly rather than inferred from the representation of a value. This is particularly true for ¤<<coordinates>>¤, which can suffer from ¤<<false precision>>¤ as a result of a format transformation. For example, 3°20’ has a ¤<<precision>>¤ of one minute, equivalent to about 0.0166667 degrees, but when stored as ¤<<decimal degrees>>¤ where five decimal places are retained and displayed the value would be 3.33333, with a ¤<<false precision>>¤ of 0.00001 degrees. Also see <<Figure 2>>.

Like ¤<<error>>¤, ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ is a measure of how different an unknown true value might be from a value given. In ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤, we use ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ to refer to the maximum distance from a center ¤<<coordinates,coordinate>>¤ of a ¤<<georeference>>¤ to the furthest point where the true ¤<<location>>¤ might be - a combination of all the possible sources of ¤<<error>>¤ given as a distance.

[[anchor-14]]1.7 Software and Online Tools

Software and tools come and go and are regularly updated, so rather than include a list in this document, we refer readers to the http://georeferencing.org/[_*georeferencing.org*_] website.

[[anchor-15]]1.8 Conformance to Standards

Throughout this document, we have, where possible, recommended practices that conform to appropriate geographic information standards and standards for the transfer of biological and geographic information. These include standards developed by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC 2019), the Technical Committee for digital geographic information and geomatics (ISO/TC 2011), and Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG). Also, this document supports the FAIR principles of data management in recommending that well georeferenced data are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.

[[anchor-16]]1.9 Persistent Identifiers (PIDs)

The use of <<Persistent Identifier (PID),*Persistent Identifiers>>* (PIDs) including <<Globally Unique Identifier (GUID),*Globally Unique Identifiers>>* (GUIDs), Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) etc. for uniquely identifying individual objects and other classes of data (such as collections, observations, images, and ¤<<location,locations>>¤) are under discussion. It is important that any identifiers used are globally unique (apply to exactly one instance of an identifiable object), persistent, and resolvable (Page 2009, Richards 2010, Richards__ et al.__ 2011). As yet, very few institutions use <<Persistent Identifier (PID),*PIDs>>* for specimens, and even fewer for ¤<<location,locations>>¤, however a recent paper by Nelson _et al_. (2018) makes a number of recommendations on minting, managing and sharing <<Globally Unique Identifier (GUID),*GUIDs>>* for herbarium specimens. We recommend that once a stable system for assigning and using <<Persistent Identifier (PID),*PIDs>>* is implemented, it be used wherever practical, including for ¤<<location,locations>>¤.

[[anchor-17]]Elements for Describing a Location

[[anchor-18]]In this section we discuss best practices for capturing and recording information so that it can be ¤<<georeference,georeferenced>>¤ and shared in the most productive and efficient way, following standard guidelines and methodologies. This will lead to improved consistency in recording, sharing, and use of data.

[[anchor-19]]Collecting data in the field sets the stage for good ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ procedures (Museum of Vertebrate Zoology 2006). Many techniques now exist that can lead to well documented ¤<<georeference,georeferenced>>¤ ¤<<location,locations>>¤. It is important, however, that the ¤<<location,locations>>¤ be recorded correctly in order to reduce the likelihood of ¤<<error>>¤. We recommend that all new collecting ¤<<event,events>>¤ use a ¤<<GPS>>¤ for recording ¤<<coordinates>>¤ wherever possible, and that the ¤<<GPS>>¤ be set to a relevant ¤<<datum>>¤ or ¤<<coordinate reference system>>¤ (see <<__*2.5 Coordinate Reference System*__>>). There are many issues that need to be considered when collecting data in the field and in this section we provide recommendations for best practice.

🐠**MARINE**. The principles as laid out in this document apply equally to marine data as to terrestrial and other data. For example, recording ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ for marine data is just as important as recording it for terrestrial systems. This is particularly important for legacy data, data from historic voyages, scientific expeditions, etc. There is also ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ for all recordings of a ¤<<georeference>>¤ － however small that may be with modern equipment. Note that there are a number of issues that apply only to marine information. We refer those working in marine systems to other parts of this document for issues such as ¤<<depth>>¤, ¤<<distance above surface>>¤, dealing with non-natural occurrences, recording ¤<<extent>>¤ of diving activities, etc. Where there are differences that specifically apply to marine ¤<<location,locations>>¤, we will identify those with the 🐠icon.

[[anchor-20]]🌳*ECOLOGICAL DATA*. ¤<<georeference,Georeferencing>>¤ ecological data, from surveys, trapping, species counts, etc. should be treated in a similar way to specimen and observation data. Often ecological data are recorded using a ¤<<grid>>¤, or ¤<<transect>>¤, and may have a starting ¤<<locality>>¤ and an ending ¤<<locality>>¤ as well as start time and end time. Where there are differences that specifically apply to ecological data, we will identify those with the 🌳icon.

🐉**CAVES**. Events in subterranean ¤<<location,locations>>¤, such as in caves, tunnels and mines, pose special problems in determining the ¤<<location>>¤. Where there are differences that specifically apply to these data, we will identify those with the 🐉icon.

[[anchor-21]]2.1 The Importance of Good Locality Data

When recording data in the field, whether from a map or when using a ¤<<GPS>>¤, it is important to record descriptive ¤<<locality>>¤ information as an independent validation of a ¤<<georeference>>¤. The extent to which validation can occur depends on how well the ¤<<locality>>¤ description and its spatial counterpart describe the same place. The highest ¤<<data quality,quality>>¤ ¤<<locality>>¤ description is one contributing the least amount of ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ possible. This is equally important for retrospective ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤, where ¤<<locality>>¤ descriptions are given and ¤<<georeference,georeferences>>¤ are not, and for ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ in the field.

[[anchor-22]]2.2 Localities

Provide a descriptive ¤<<locality>>¤, even if you have ¤<<coordinates>>¤. The ¤<<locality>>¤ should be as specific, succinct, unambiguous, complete, and as ¤<<accuracy,accurate>>¤ as possible, leaving no room for multiple interpretations.

¤<<feature,Features>>¤ used as reference points should be stable,_ i.e_., places (permanent landmarks, ¤<<trig point,trig points>>¤, etc.) that will remain unchanged for a long time after the ¤<<event>>¤ is recorded. Do NOT use temporary ¤<<feature,features>>¤ or waypoints as the key reference ¤<<locality>>¤.

To facilitate the validation of a ¤<<locality>>¤, use reference ¤<<feature,features>>¤ that are easy to find on maps or in ¤<<gazetteer,gazetteers>>¤. At all costs, avoid using vague terms such as "near" and "center of" or providing only an ¤<<offset>>¤ without a distance, such as "West of Jiuquan", or worse "W Jiuquan".

In any ¤<<locality>>¤ that contains a ¤<<feature>>¤ that can be confused with another ¤<<feature>>¤ of a different type, specify the ¤<<feature>>¤ type in parentheses following the ¤<<feature>>¤ name, for example, "Clear Lake (populated place)".

If recording locations on a ¤<<path>>¤ (road, river, etc.), it is important to also record whether the distances were measured along the actual ¤<<path>>¤ (_e.g._, ‘by road’) or as a direct line from the origin (_e.g._, ‘by air’).

TIP: The most specific <<locality,localities>> are those described by a) a distance and heading along a <<path>> from a nearby and well-defined intersection, or b) two cardinal offset distances from a single persistent nearby <<feature>> of small <<extent>>.

By describing a ¤<<location>>¤ in terms of a distance along a ¤<<path>>¤, or by two orthogonal distances from a ¤<<feature>>¤, one removes ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ due to ¤<<precision,imprecise>>¤ ¤<<heading,headings>>¤, which, when the distances are great, can be the biggest contributing factor to overall ¤<<uncertainty>>¤. Choosing a reference ¤<<feature>>¤ with small ¤<<extent>>¤ reduces the ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ due to the size of the reference ¤<<feature>>¤, and by choosing a nearby reference ¤<<feature>>¤, one reduces the potential for ¤<<error>>¤ in measuring the ¤<<offset>>¤ distances, especially along ¤<<path,paths>>¤. The Museum of Vertebrate Zoology at the University of California, Berkeley has published a guide to recording good ¤<<locality,localities>>¤ in the field that follows these principles. Following is an example ¤<<locality>>¤ from that document (copied with permission).

*Example:*

*Locality: "Modoc National Wildlife Refuge, 2.8 mi S and 1.2 mi E junction of Hwy. 299 and Hwy. 395 in Alturas, Modoc Co., Calif.*"

*Lat/Long/Datum:* 41.45063, −120.50763 (WGS84)

*Elevation:* 1330 ft

*GPS Accuracy:* 24 ft

*Radial:* 150 ft

*References:* Garmin Etrex Summit GPS for coordinates and accuracy, barometric altimeter for elevation.

** (**From http://mvz.berkeley.edu/Locality_Field_Recording_Notebooks.html[_MVZ Guide for Recording Localities in Field Notes_])

When recording a ¤<<location>>¤ that does not have a ¤<<feature>>¤ that can be easily referenced, for example a 🐠dive location in the middle of the ocean (see ¤<<entry point>>¤) or using some other marker that may only be recorded as a ¤<<latitude>>¤ and ¤<<longitude>>¤, also record the provenance of the ¤<<location>>¤ (_e.g._, device or method used to determine the ¤<<coordinates>>¤ such as "transcription from ship’s log", etc.).

[[anchor-23]]2.3 Extent of a Location

The ¤<<extent>>¤ of a ¤<<location>>¤ is the totality of the space it occupies. The ¤<<extent>>¤ is a simple way to alert the user that, for example, all of the specimens collected or observations made at the stated ¤<<coordinates>>¤ were actually within an area of up to 0.5 kilometers from that point. It can be quite helpful at times to include in your field notes a large-scale (highly detailed) map of the local vicinity for each ¤<<locality>>¤, marking the area in which ¤<<event,events>>¤ actually occurred.

The ¤<<extent>>¤ may be a linear distance, an area or a volume represented by one or more buffered points (_i.e._, a ¤<<point-radius>>¤), buffered lines (_e.g._, ¤<<transect,transects>>¤, ¤<<stratigraphic section,stratigraphic sections>>¤), polygons, or other ¤<<geometry,geometries>>¤ in two or three dimensions (sphere, cube, etc.).

A ¤<<location>>¤ can be anchored to a position (as ¤<<coordinates>>¤, potentially in combination with ¤<<elevation>>¤, ¤<<depth>>¤ and ¤<<distance above surface>>¤) within the ¤<<extent>>¤. This may be the corner or center of a ¤<<grid>>¤, the center of a polygon, the center of a circle, etc.

The ¤<<geographic extent>>¤ is the space occupied by the ¤<<location>>¤ when projected onto a 2D *<<coordinate reference system>>* in ¤<<geographic coordinates>>¤ (_e.g._, ¤<<latitude>>¤ and ¤<<longitude>>¤ in ¤<<decimal degrees>>¤ in <<**WGS84>> <<datum>>** on Google Maps™). The ¤<<geographic radial>>¤ is the line segment from the ¤<<corrected center>>¤ of the ¤<<location>>¤ to the furthest point on the ¤<<boundary>>¤ of the ¤<<geographic extent>>¤ of that ¤<<location>>¤. This simplified representation may be convenient for many uses, as long as the references to the ¤<<extent>>¤ are not lost. With the ¤<<coordinates>>¤ alone, the nature of the ¤<<extent>>¤ and the variety of conditions found therein will be lost, thus sacrificing the utility of the spatial information about the ¤<<location>>¤ and the contexts in which the data can be used.

When recording observations, whether by people or from fixed recording instruments such as camera traps (Cadman & González-Talaván 2014), sound recorders, etc., the ¤<<extent>>¤ should include the effective field of view (for camera traps) or area of detectable signals covered by the sound recorders, etc. In these cases the most faithful representation of the ¤<<location>>¤ (the one that would allow for the least ¤<<maximum uncertainty distance>>¤) should have the ¤<<coordinates>>¤ at the center of the ¤<<extent>>¤ of the field of detection, not at the position of the recording device or person. The true ¤<<location>>¤ may need to be calculated from the ¤<<coordinates>>¤ of the device using the ¤<<radial>>¤ and ¤<<point-radius>> <<georeferencing method>>¤. If the position of the device or person is the only practical way to give the ¤<<coordinates>>¤, then the ¤<<radial>>¤ for the ¤<<location>>¤ is the length of the furthest distance in the field of detection.

For 🐠diving activities, the ¤<<coordinates>>¤ are recorded as an ¤<<entry point>>¤ into the water and the ¤<<locality>>¤ is recorded with reference to that ¤<<entry point>>¤. For example, "sampling was conducted in a rough sphere of 30 meters diameter, whose center was located 300 meters due west of the ¤<<entry point>>¤ at a ¤<<depth>>¤ between 50 and 100 meters". In these cases the ¤<<radial>>¤ must be big enough to encompass the position within the ¤<<extent>>¤ farthest from the ¤<<entry point>>¤ (see <<Figure 7>>).

[[anchor-24]]2.3.1 Transects

🌳🐠For a ¤<<location>>¤ that is a ¤<<transect>>¤, record both the start and end points of the line. This allows the orientation and ¤<<direction>>¤ of the ¤<<transect>>¤ to be preserved. If the ¤<<event,events>>¤ associated with the ¤<<transect>>¤ occur within a given maximum distance from the ¤<<transect>>¤, it is better to represent the ¤<<location>>¤ as a polygon (see <<__*2.3.3 Polygons*__>>). If the ¤<<event,events>>¤ associated with the ¤<<transect>>¤ can be reasonably separated into their individual ¤<<location,locations>>¤, it is better to do so, as these will be more specific than the ¤<<transect>>¤ as a whole. If that is done, however, ensure that you document that each individual ¤<<location>>¤ is part of a ¤<<transect>>¤.

If the ¤<<locality>>¤ is recorded as the center of the ¤<<transect>>¤ and half the length of the ¤<<transect>>¤ is then used to describe ¤<<uncertainty>>¤, information about the orientation of the ¤<<transect>>¤ is lost, and the description essentially becomes equivalent to a circle.

[[anchor-25]]2.3.2 Paths

Not all linear-based ¤<<location,locations>>¤ are ¤<<transect,transects>>¤ or straight lines. We use the term ¤<<path>>¤ to highlight this broader concept. Illustrative examples are: _ad-hoc_ observations while walking along a trail, an inventory or count of species while travelling along a river, tracking an individual animal’s movements. 🐠Marine ¤<<transect,transects>>¤, tracks, tows, and trawls, are further examples. ¤<<path,Paths>>¤ should be described using <<shape,*shapes>> *(see discussion under <<__*3.3.4 Shape method*__>>) as connected line segments (a polygonal chain), with the ¤<<coordinates>>¤ of the starting point followed by the ¤<<coordinates>>¤ of each segment beginning and finishing with the end point. One simple way to store and share these is through https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry[_Well-Known Text_] (WKT, ISO 2016) (De Pooter, _et al._ 2017, OBIS _n.dat._, W.Appeltans, _pers. comm._ 15 Apr. 2019).

To determine the ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ of a described ¤<<path>>¤ using the ¤<<point-radius>> <<georeferencing method>>¤, one needs to determine the ¤<<corrected center>>¤ - _i.e.,_ the point on the ¤<<path>>¤ that describes the ¤<<smallest enclosing circle>>¤ that includes the totality of the ¤<<path>>¤ ("c" on <<Figure 3>>). This is very seldom the same place as the center of a line joining the two ends of the ¤<<path>>¤ ("y" on <<Figure 3>>), nor the center of the extremes of ¤<<latitude>>¤ and ¤<<longitude>>¤ (the ¤<<geographic center>>¤) of the ¤<<path>>¤ ("x" on <<Figure 3>>)*.*

[[anchor-26]]2.3.3 Polygons

When collecting or recording data from an area, for example, bird counts on a lake, a set of nesting or roosting sites on an offshore coral cay, or a buffered ¤<<transect>>¤ - the ¤<<location>>¤ is best recorded as a polygon. Polygons can be stored using the ¤<<Darwin Core>>¤ (Wieczorek _et al_. 2012b) field called _*dwc:footprintWKT*_, in which a ¤<<geometry>>¤ can be stored in the Well-Known Text format (ISO 2016). For the ¤<<point-radius>> <<georeferencing method>>¤, if the polygon has a concave shape (for example a crescent), the center may not actually fall within the polygon (<<Figure 4>>). In that case, the ¤<<corrected center>>¤ on the ¤<<boundary>>¤ of the polygon is used for the ¤<<coordinates>>¤ of the ¤<<location>>¤ and the ¤<<geographic radial>>¤ is measured from that point to the furthest extremity of the polygon. Note that the circle based on the ¤<<corrected center>>¤ (red circle in <<Figure 4>>) will always be greater than the circle based on the ¤<<geographic center>>¤ (black circle in <<Figure 4>>).

*Figure 4.* The town of Caraguitatuba in SP, Brazil (a complicated polygon), showing the center ('*x*') of the ¤<<smallest enclosing circle>>¤ encompassing the whole of the town, and the ¤<<corrected center>>¤ ('*c*') - the nearest place on the ¤<<boundary>>¤ to '*x*. '*r*' is the ¤<<geographic radial>>¤ of the larger, red circle.

Complex polygons, such as donuts, self-intersecting polygons and multipolygons create even more problems, in both documentation and storage.

[[anchor-27]]2.3.4 Grids

¤<<grid,Grids>>¤ may be based on the lines of ¤<<latitude>>¤ and ¤<<longitude>>¤, or they may be cells in a cartesian ¤<<coordinate system>>¤ based on distances from a reference point. Usually ¤<<grid,grids>>¤ are aligned North-South, and if not, their ¤<<magnetic declination>>¤ is essential to record. If the ¤<<extent>>¤ of a ¤<<location>>¤ is a ¤<<grid>>¤ cell, then the ideal way to record it would be the **polygon** consisting of the corners of the ¤<<grid>>¤ (_i.e._, a ¤<<bounding box>>¤). The ¤<<point-radius>>¤ method can be used to capture the ¤<<coordinates>>¤ of the ¤<<grid>>¤ cell center and the distance from there to one of the furthest corners, but given that the ¤<<geometry,geometries>>¤ for ¤<<grid>>¤ cells are so simple, it is best to also capture them as polygons. Often ¤<<grid>>¤ cells (_e.g._, geographic <<grid,grids>>) are described using the ¤<<coordinates>>¤ of the southwest corner of the ¤<<grid>>¤. Using the southwest corner as the ¤<<coordinate>>¤ for a ¤<<point-radius>>¤ ¤<<georeference>>¤ is wasteful, since the ¤<<geographic radial>>¤ would be from there to the farthest corner, which would be twice as far as it would be if the center of the ¤<<grid>>¤ cell was used instead. In any case, the characteristics of the ¤<<grid>>¤ should be recorded with the ¤<<locality>>¤ information.

It is important when converting gridded data to ¤<<geographic coordinates>>¤ to also check the ¤<<locality>>¤ description. ¤<<locality,Locality>>¤ information may allow you to refine the ¤<<location>>¤ as in <<Figure 5>> where just having the ¤<<grid,grids>>¤ without the ¤<<locality>>¤ information (_i.e._ "on Northey Island") would lead to the circle (c) with its center (a) at the center of the ¤<<grid>>¤. Knowing that the record is on Northey Island, however, allows you to refine the ¤<<location>>¤ to the smaller circle (d) with its center at (b). Note that other criteria (such as a change of ¤<<datum>>¤, map scale**, **etc.) may add to the ¤<<uncertainty>>¤.

[[anchor-28]]2.3.4.1 Township, Range and Section and Equivalents

Township, Range and Section (TRS) or Public Land Survey System (PLSS) is a ¤<<grid>>¤-like way of dividing land into townships in the mid- and western USA. Sections are usually 1 mile on each side and townships usually consist of 36 sections arranged in a ¤<<grid>>¤ with a specific numbering system. Not all townships are square, however, as there may be irregularities based on administrative boundaries, for example. For this reason, though these systems resemble ¤<<grid,grids>>¤, they are best treated as individual polygons. Similar subdivisions are used in other countries

[[anchor-29]]2.3.4.2 Quarter Degree Squares

Quarter Degree Squares (QDS) or QDGC (Quarter Degree Grid Cells) (Larsen _et al._ 2009) have been used in many historical African biodiversity atlas projects and continue to be used for current South African biodiversity projects such as the Atlas of South African birds (Larsen _et al._ 2009, Larsen 2012). It has also been recommended as the method to use for ¤<<generalization,generalizing>>¤ sensitive biodiversity data in South Africa (SANBI 2016, Chapman 2020).

Unlike most geographic ¤<<grid>>¤ systems, which have their origin in the bottom left corner of the ¤<<grid>>¤, QDS ¤<<grid,grids>>¤ reference their origin from the top left corner. ¤<<grid,Grids>>¤ are identified by a code that consists of 4 numbers and two letters (_e.g._, 2624BD). The code can be worked out as follows:

* Each degree square is designated by a four digit number made up of the values of ¤<<latitude>>¤ and ¤<<longitude>>¤ at its top left corner, for example, 3218 for the larger square in <<Figure 6>>.
* Each degree square is divided into sixteen quarter-degree squares, each 15’ x 15’. These are given two additional letters as indicated. Thus in <<Figure 6>>, the hatched area is represented by the code 3218CB.

Note that QDS is developed for use in Africa, and currently only works in the Southern Hemisphere. It has been suggested that it be extended for use in the Northern Hemisphere, but this is not yet under development.

[[anchor-31]]2.3.5 Three Dimensional Shapes

Most terrestrial ¤<<location,locations>>¤ are recorded with reference to the terrestrial surface as ¤<<geographic coordinates>>¤, sometimes with ¤<<elevation>>¤. Some types of 🐠marine *events* such as dives and trawls, benefit from explicit description in three dimensions.

🐠Diving ¤<<event,events>>¤ are commonly recorded using the ¤<<geographic coordinates>>¤ of the point on the surface where the diver entered the water, called ¤<<entry point>>¤ or point of entry. The underwater ¤<<location>>¤ should be recorded as a horizontal distance and ¤<<direction>>¤ along with water ¤<<depth>>¤ from that surface ¤<<location>>¤ (see <<Figure 7>>). Below the surface the diver may then begin a collection/observation exercise in three dimensions from that point including a horizontal component and a minimum and maximum water ¤<<depth>>¤. These should all be recorded. The reference point should be the ¤<<corrected center>>¤ of the 3D-shape that includes the ¤<<extent>>¤ of the ¤<<location>>¤. The ¤<<geographic radial>>¤ would be the distance from the ¤<<corrected center>>¤ of the 3D shape (the three dimensions projected perpendicularly onto the surface) to the furthest extremity of the projection of the 3D-shape in the horizontal plane (_i.e._, on the ¤<<geographic boundary>>¤).

image:img/Pictures/100002010000021800000124610F5CF49CEB08C3.png[image,width=511,height=278]

*Figure 7.* Recording the ¤<<location>>¤ of an underwater ¤<<event>>¤. '*E*' denotes ¤<<entry point>>¤, the surface ¤<<location>>¤ at which the ¤<<geographic coordinates>>¤ are recorded. '*x*' is the water ¤<<depth>>¤, '*y*' is the horizontal ¤<<offset>>¤ (distance and direction) from '*E*' to the center of the ¤<<location>>¤. <<extent,*Extent>> *'*e*' is the three-dimensional ¤<<location>>¤ covered by the ¤<<event>>¤. The ¤<<corrected center>>¤ '*cc*' is the point within the 3D shape that minimizes the length of the ¤<<geographic radial>>¤ '*gr*'. Minimum ¤<<depth>>¤ '*d1*' and maximum ¤<<depth>>¤ '*d2*' are the upper and lower limits of the ¤<<location>>¤.

🐠There are many different types of trawls and tows, including bottom and mid-water trawls. The 3D nature should be captured as above. The geographic reference points would be line segments tracing the route of the trawl, and would be more akin to ¤<<path,paths>>¤ and captured as a ¤<<shape>>¤ as described above under <<__*2.3.2 Paths*__>>.

[[anchor-32]]2.4 Coordinates

Whenever practical, provide the ¤<<coordinates>>¤ of the ¤<<location>>¤ where an ¤<<event>>¤ actually occurred (see <<__*2.3 Extent of a Location*__>>) and accompany these with the ¤<<coordinate reference system>>¤ of the ¤<<coordinates,coordinate>>¤ source (map or ¤<<GPS>>¤). The two ¤<<coordinate system,coordinate systems>>¤ most commonly used by biologists are based on ¤<<geographic coordinates>>¤ (_i.e._, ¤<<latitude>>¤ and ¤<<longitude>>¤) or Universal Transverse Mercator (¤<<UTM>>¤) (_i.e._, ¤<<easting>>¤, ¤<<northing>>¤, and ¤<<UTM>>¤ zone).

A ¤<<datum>>¤ is an essential part of a ¤<<coordinate reference system>>¤ and provides the frame of reference. Without it the ¤<<coordinates>>¤ are ambiguous. When using both maps and ¤<<GPS>>¤ in the field, set the ¤<<coordinate reference system>>¤ or ¤<<datum>>¤ of the ¤<<GPS>>¤ or ¤<<GNSS>>¤ receiver to be the same as that of the map so that the ¤<<GPS>>¤ ¤<<coordinates>>¤ for a ¤<<location>>¤ will match those on the map. Be sure to record the ¤<<coordinate reference system>>¤ or ¤<<datum>>¤ used.

[[anchor-33]]2.4.1 Geographic Coordinates

¤<<geographic coordinates,Geographic coordinates>>¤ are a convenient way to define a ¤<<location>>¤ in a way that is not only more specific than is otherwise possible with a ¤<<locality>>¤ description, but also readily allows calculations to be made in a ¤<<geographic information system,GIS>>¤. ¤<<geographic coordinates,Geographic coordinates>>¤ can be expressed in a number of different ¤<<coordinate format,coordinate formats>>¤ (¤<<decimal degrees>>¤, ¤<<DMS,degrees minutes seconds>>¤, degrees decimal minutes), with ¤<<decimal degrees>>¤ being the most commonly used. ¤<<geographic coordinates,Geographic coordinates>>¤ in ¤<<decimal degrees>>¤ are convenient for ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ because this succinct format has global applicability and relies on just three attributes, one for ¤<<latitude>>¤, one for ¤<<longitude>>¤, and one for the ¤<<geodetic datum>>¤ or ¤<<ellipsoid>>¤, which, together with the ¤<<coordinate format>>¤, make up the ¤<<coordinate reference system>>¤. By keeping the number of recorded attributes to a minimum, the chances for transcription ¤<<error,errors>>¤ are minimized (Wieczorek _et al._ 2004).

When capturing ¤<<geographic coordinates>>¤, always include as many decimals of ¤<<precision>>¤ as given by the ¤<<coordinates,coordinate>>¤ source. ¤<<coordinates,Coordinates>>¤ in ¤<<decimal degrees>>¤ given to five decimal places are more ¤<<precision,precise>>¤ than a measurement in ¤<<DMS,degrees, minutes, and seconds>>¤ to the nearest second, and more ¤<<precision,precise>>¤ than a measurement in degrees and decimal minutes given to three decimal places (see <<Table 3>>). Some new ¤<<GPS>>¤/¤<<GNSS>>¤ receivers now display data in decimal seconds to two decimal places, which corresponds to less than a meter everywhere on earth. This doesn't mean that the ¤<<GPS>>¤ reading is ¤<<accuracy,accurate>>¤ at that scale, only that the ¤<<coordinates>>¤ as given do not contribute additional ¤<<uncertainty>>¤.

TIP: <<decimal degrees,_*Decimal degrees>> are preferred when capturing <<coordinates>> from a <<GPS>>, however, where reference to maps is important, and where the <<GPS>> receiver allows, set the recorder to report in degrees, minutes, and decimal seconds.

[[anchor-34]]2.4.2 Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Coordinates

**<<UTM,Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM), **is a system for assigning distance-based ¤<<coordinates>>¤ using a mercator ¤<<projection>>¤ from an idealized ¤<<ellipsoid>>¤ of the surface of the earth onto a plane. In most applications of the ¤<<UTM>>¤ system, the earth is divided into a series of six-degree wide ¤<<longitude,longitudinal>>¤ zones extending between 80°S and 84°N and numbered from 1-60 beginning with the zone at the <<antimeridian,*Antimeridian>> *(Snyder 1987). Because of the ¤<<latitude,latitudinal>>¤ limitation in extent, <<**UTM>> <<coordinates>> **are not usable in the extreme polar regions of the earth. A map of ¤<<UTM>>¤ zones can be found at http://www.dmap.co.uk/utmworld.htm[_UTM Grid Zones of the World_] (Morton 2006).

*<<UTM>>* ¤<<coordinates>>¤ consist of a zone number, a hemisphere indicator (N or S), and ¤<<easting>>¤ and ¤<<northing>>¤ coordinate pairs separated by a space with 6 and 7 digits respectively, and all in the order given here. For example, for Big Ben in London (¤<<latitude>>¤ 51.500721, ¤<<longitude>>¤ -0.124430), the ¤<<UTM>>¤ reference would be: 30N 699582 5709431.

*<<latitude,Latitude>>* bands are not officially part of ¤<<UTM>>¤, but are used in the Military Grid Reference System (MGRS). They are used in many applications, including in Google Earth™. Each zone is subdivided into 20 ¤<<latitude,latitudinal>>¤ bands, with letters used from South to North starting with "C" at 80°S to "X" (stretched by an extra 4 degrees) at 72°N (to 84°N) and omitting "O". All letters below "N" are in the southern hemisphere, "N" and above are in the northern hemisphere. When using ¤<<latitude,latitudinal>>¤ bands, "north" and "south" need to be spelled out to avoid confusion with the ¤<<latitude,latitudinal>>¤ bands of "N" and "S" respectively. Using the ¤<<latitude,latitudinal>>¤ band method, the ¤<<coordinates>>¤ for Big Ben would be: 30T 699582m east 5709431m north.

National and local ¤<<grid>>¤ systems derived from ¤<<UTM>>¤, but which may be based on different ¤<<ellipsoid,ellipsoids>>¤ and ¤<<datum,datums>>¤, are basically used in the same way as ¤<<UTM>>¤s. For example, the Map Grid of Australia (MGA2020) uses ¤<<UTM>>¤ with the GRS80 ¤<<ellipsoid>>¤ and Geocentric Datum of Australia (GDA2020) (Geoscience Australia 2019b). An example of a ¤<<location>>¤ in MGA2020 is "MGA Zone 56, x: 301545 y: 7011991"

When recording a ¤<<location>>¤, or databasing using ¤<<UTM>>¤ or equivalent ¤<<coordinates>>¤, a zone should ALWAYS be included; otherwise the data are of little or no value when used outside that zone, and certainly of little use when combined with data from other zones. Zones are often not reported where a region (_e.g._, Tasmania) falls completely within one ¤<<UTM>>¤ zone. This is OK while the database remains regional, but is not suitable for exchange outside of the zone. When exporting data from databases like these, the region’s zone should be added prior to export or transfer. Better still, modify the database so that the zone remains with the ¤<<coordinates>>¤.

Note that ¤<<Darwin Core>>¤ (Wieczorek _et al_. 2012b) supports ¤<<UTM>>¤ ¤<<coordinates>>¤ only in the _verbatimCoordinates_ field. There are several tools to convert ¤<<UTM>> <<coordinates>>¤ to ¤<<geographic coordinates>>¤, including http://home.hiwaay.net/~taylorc/toolbox/geography/geoutm.html[_Geographic/UTM Coordinate Converter_] (Taylor 2003) - see http://georeferencing.org/tools.html[_http://georeferencing.org/tools.htm_]http://georeferencing.org/tools.html[_l_]. For details on ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤, see <<__*2.3.2 Coordinates - Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)*__>> in Zermoglio _et al. _(2020).

TIP: If using <<UTM>> <<coordinates>>, always record the <<UTM>> zone and the <<datum>> or <<coordinate reference system>>.

[[anchor-35]]2.5 Coordinate Reference System

Except under special circumstances (the poles, for example), ¤<<coordinates>>¤ without a ¤<<coordinate reference system>>¤ do not uniquely specify a ¤<<location>>¤. Confusion about the ¤<<coordinate reference system>>¤ can result in positional ¤<<error,errors>>¤ of hundreds of meters. Positional shifts between what is recorded on some maps and ¤<<WGS84>>¤, for example, may be between zero and 5359 m (Wieczorek 2019).

An unofficial (not governed by a standards body) set of ¤<<EPSG>>¤ (IOGP 2019) codes are often used (and misused) to designate ¤<<datum,datums>>¤. There are ¤<<EPSG>>¤ codes for a variety of entities (¤<<coordinate reference system,coordinate reference systems>>¤, areas of use, ¤<<prime meridian,prime meridians>>¤, ¤<<ellipsoid,ellipsoids>>¤, etc.) in addition to ¤<<datum,datums>>¤, and the codes for these are often confused. For example, the code for the ¤<<WGS84>>¤ ¤<<coordinate reference system>>¤ is epsg:4326, while the code for the ¤<<WGS84>>¤ ¤<<datum>>¤ is epsg:6326 and the code for the ¤<<WGS84>>¤ ¤<<ellipsoid>>¤ is epsg:6422. The ¤<<EPSG>>¤ code has the advantage (when properly chosen) that it is explicit which type of entity it refers to, unlike the common name alone (_e.g._, "¤<<WGS84>>¤" alone could refer to the ¤<<coordinate reference system>>¤, the ¤<<datum>>¤, or the ¤<<ellipsoid>>¤). Increasingly, ¤<<GPS>>¤ units are reporting ¤<<coordinate reference system,coordinate reference systems>>¤ as ¤<<EPSG>>¤ codes. Knowing the ¤<<EPSG>>¤ code for the ¤<<coordinate reference system>>¤, one can determine the ¤<<datum>>¤ and ¤<<ellipsoid>>¤ for that system. It is thus recommended to record the ¤<<EPSG>>¤ code of the ¤<<coordinate reference system>>¤ if possible, otherwise, record the ¤<<EPSG>>¤ code of the ¤<<datum>>¤ if possible, otherwise, record the ¤<<EPSG>>¤ code of the ¤<<ellipsoid>>¤. If none of these can be determined from the ¤<<coordinates,coordinate>>¤ source, record "not recorded". This is important, as it determines the ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ due to an unknown ¤<<datum>>¤ (see <<__*3.4.4 Uncertainty from Unknown Datum*__>>) and has potentially drastic implications for the ¤<<maximum uncertainty distance>>¤.

Sources of ¤<<EPSG>>¤ codes include epsg.io (Maptiler 2019), Apache (2019), EPSG Dataset version 9.1 (IOGP 2019), and Geomatic Solutions (2018). When using a ¤<<GPS>>¤, it is important to set and record the ¤<<EPSG>>¤ code of the ¤<<coordinate reference system>>¤ or ¤<<datum>>¤. See discussion below under <<__*3.4 Calculating Uncertainties*__>>__.__

TIP: If you are not basing your <<locality>> description on a map, set your <<GPS>> to report <<coordinates>> using the <<WGS84>> <<datum>> or a recent local <<datum>> that approximates <<WGS84>> (that may, for example, be legislated for your country) or the appropriate <<coordinate reference system,Coordinate Reference System>> (<<EPSG>> Code). Record the <<datum>> used in all your documentation.

[[anchor-36]]2.6 Using a GPS

*<<GPS>>* (Global Positioning System) technology uses triangulation between a ¤<<GPS>>¤/¤<<GNSS>>¤ receiver and ¤<<GPS>>¤ or ¤<<GNSS>>¤ satellites (Kaplan & Hegarty 2006, Van Sickle 2015, Novatel 2015). As the ¤<<GNSS>>¤ satellites are at known positions in space, and the ¤<<GPS>>¤/¤<<GNSS>>¤ receiver can determine the distances to the detected satellites, the position on earth can be calculated. A minimum of four ¤<<GNSS>>¤ satellites is required to determine a position on the earth’s surface (McElroy _et al._ 2007, Van Sickle 2015). This is not generally a limitation today, as one can often receive signals from a large number of satellites (up to 20 or more in some areas). Note, however, that just because your ¤<<GNSS>>¤ receiver is showing lots of satellites, it doesn’t mean that all are being used as the receiver’s ability to make use of additional satellites may be limited by its computational power (Novatel 2015). In the past, many ¤<<GPS>>¤ units only referenced the ¤<<GPS>>¤ (USA) satellites of which there are currently 31 (April 2019), but now many ¤<<GPS>>¤/¤<<GNSS>>¤ receivers are designed to access systems from other countries as well - such as GLONASS (Russia), BeiDou-2 (China), Galileo (Europe), NAVIC (India), and QZSS (Japan), making a total of about 112 currently accessible satellites (2019) with a further 23 to be brought into operation over the next few years. This number is increasing rapidly every year (Braun 2019). Prior to the removal of Selective Availability in May 2000, the ¤<<accuracy>>¤ of handheld__ <<__**GPS>>**__ __receivers in the field was around 100 meters or worse (McElroy _et al_. 2007, Leick 1995). The removal of this signal degradation technique has greatly improved the ¤<<accuracy>>¤ that can now generally be expected from ¤<<GPS>>¤ receivers (GPS.gov 2018).

To obtain the best possible ¤<<accuracy>>¤, the ¤<<GPS>>¤/¤<<GNSS>>¤ receiver must be located in an area that is free from overhead obstructions and reflective surfaces and have a good field of view to a broad portion of the sky (for example, they do not work very well under a heavy forest canopy, although new satellite signal technology is improving the ¤<<accuracy>>¤ in these locations (Moore 2017)). The ¤<<GPS>>¤/¤<<GNSS>>¤ receiver must be able to record signals from at least four ¤<<GNSS>>¤ satellites in a suitable geometric arrangement. The best arrangement is to have "_one satellite directly overhead and the other three equally spaced_ _around the horizon_" (McElroy _et al. 2007_). The ¤<<GPS>>¤/¤<<GNSS>>¤ receiver must also be set to an appropriate ¤<<datum>>¤ or ¤<<coordinate reference system>>¤ (CRS) for the area, and the ¤<<datum>>¤ or ¤<<coordinate reference system,CRS>>¤ that was used must be recorded (Chapman _et al._ 2005a).

TIP: Set your <<GPS>> to report <<location,locations>> in <<decimal degrees>> rather than make a conversion from another <<coordinate system>> as it is usually more <<precision,precise>> (see <<Table 3>> in <<3.4.3. Uncertainty Related to Coordinate Precision>>), better and easier to store, and saves later transformations, which may introduce <<error>>.

TIP: An alternative where reference to maps is important, and where the <<GPS>> receiver allows it, is to set the recorder to report in degrees, minutes, and decimal seconds.

[[anchor-37]]2.6.1 Choosing a GPS or GNSS Receiver

One of the most important issues for consideration when choosing a ¤<<GPS>>¤ or ¤<<GNSS>>¤ receiver is the antenna. An antenna behaves both as a spatial and frequency filter, therefore, selecting the right antenna is critical for optimizing performance (Novatel 2015). One of the drawbacks with smartphones, for example, is the limited size of the ¤<<GNSS>>¤ antenna.

For information on issues to consider when selecting an appropriate ¤<<GNSS>>¤ antenna and/or ¤<<GPS>>¤ receiver, we refer you to Chapter 2 in Novatel (2015) and Chapter 10 in NLWRA (2008).

[[anchor-38]]2.6.2 GPS Accuracy

Most ¤<<GPS>>¤ devices are able to report a theoretical horizontal ¤<<accuracy>>¤ based on local conditions at the time of reading (atmospheric conditions, reflectance, forest cover, etc.). For highly specific ¤<<location,locations>>¤, it may be possible for the potential ¤<<error>>¤ in the ¤<<GPS>>¤ reading to be on the same order of magnitude as the ¤<<extent>>¤ of the ¤<<location>>¤. In these cases, the ¤<<GPS>>¤ ¤<<accuracy>>¤ can make a non-trivial contribution to the overall ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ of a ¤<<georeference>>¤.

The latest US Government commitment (US Dept of Defence and GPS Navstar 2008) is to broadcast the ¤<<GPS>>¤ signal in space "_with a global average user range error (URE) of ≤7.8 m (25.6 ft.), with 95% probability_". In reality, actual performance exceeds this, and in May 2016, the global average URE was ≤ 0.715__ __m (2.3__ __ft), 95% of the time (GPS.gov 2017). Though it does not mean that all receivers can obtain that ¤<<accuracy>>¤, the ¤<<accuracy>>¤ of ¤<<GPS>>¤ receivers has improved and today most manufacturers of handheld ¤<<GPS>>¤ units promise errors of less than 5__ __meters in open areas when using four or more satellites. The need for four or more satellites to achieve these ¤<<accuracy,accuracies>>¤ is because of the inaccuracies in the clocks of the ¤<<GPS>>¤ receivers as opposed to the much more ¤<<accuracy,accurate>>¤ satellite clocks (Novatel 2015). The ¤<<accuracy>>¤ can be improved by averaging the results of multiple observations at a single location (McElroy __et al. __2007), and some modern ¤<<GPS>>¤ receivers that include averaging algorithms can bring the ¤<<accuracy>>¤ to around three meters or less. According to GISGeography (2019a), “_A well-designed GPS receiver can achieve a horizontal accuracy of 3 meters or better and vertical accuracy of 5 meters or better 95% of the time. Augmented GPS systems can provide sub-meter accuracy_”.. Another method to improve <<**accuracy>** is to average over more than one ¤<<GPS>>¤ unit. Note that some ¤<<GPS>>¤/¤<<GNSS>>¤ receivers can record up to 20 decimal places of ¤<<precision>>¤, but that doesn’t mean that is the ¤<<accuracy>>¤ of the unit.

[[anchor-39]]2.6.3 Differential GNSS

The use of Differential ¤<<GNSS>>¤ (DGNSS) (incorporating Differential ¤<<GPS>>¤_ _(DGPS)) can improve ¤<<accuracy>>¤ considerably. DGNSS references a ¤<<GNSS>>¤ Base Station (usually a survey control point) at a known position to calibrate the receiving ¤<<GNSS>>¤ signal. The Base Station and handheld ¤<<GNSS>>¤ receiver reference the satellites’ positions at the same time and thus reduces¤<<error>>¤ due to atmospheric conditions, as well as (to a lesser extent) satellite ephemeris (orbital location) and clock ¤<<error>>¤ (Novatel 2015). The handheld ¤<<GNSS>>¤ instrument applies the appropriate corrections to the determined position. Depending on the ¤<<data quality,quality>>¤ of the receivers used, one can expect an ¤<<accuracy>>¤ of <1 meter (USGS, 2017). This ¤<<accuracy>>¤ decreases as the distance of the receiver from the Base Station increases. It is important to note that differential technology is not available in all areas - for example, in remote ¤<<location,locations>>¤ and remote islands, and the resulting ¤<<accuracy>>¤ may be less than expected. Again, averaging can further improve on these values (McElroy __et al. __2007). It is important to note, however, that most DGNSS is post-processed. Records are stored in the ¤<<GPS>>¤/¤<<GNSS>>¤ unit and then post-processing software is run to improve the measurements once connected to a computer. Post processing is not as commonly used since the introduction of real-time DGNSS, such as the ¤<<SBAS,Satellite Based Augmentation System>>¤, see the next subsection below), and is now used mostly in surveying applications where high ¤<<accuracy>>¤ is required.

🐠Marine horizontal position ¤<<accuracy>>¤ requirements are 2-5 meters (at a 95 percent confidence level) for safety of navigation in inland waters, 8-20 meters (95%) in harbor entrances and approaches, and horizontal position ¤<<accuracy,accuracies>>¤ of 1-100 meters (95%) for resource exploration in coastal regions (Skone 2004, Skone & Yousuf 2007). While DGNSS horizontal ¤<<error>>¤ bounds are specified as 10 meters (95%) studies have shown that under normal operating conditions ¤<<accuracy,accuracies>>¤ fall well within this bound.

DGNSS ¤<<accuracy,accuracies>>¤ are susceptible to severe degradation due to enhanced ionospheric effects associated with geomagnetic storms. Degradation can be in the order of 2-30 times in some areas and depending on the severity of the storm.

[[anchor-40]]2.6.4 Satellite Based Augmentation System

Satellite Based Augmentation System (¤<<SBAS>>¤) is a collection of geosynchronous satellites originally developed for precision guidance of aircraft (Federal Aviation Administration 2004) and more recently to provide services for improving the ¤<<accuracy>>¤, integrity and availability of basic ¤<<GNSS>>¤ signals (Novatel 2015). ¤<<SBAS>>¤ receivers are inexpensive examples of real-time differential correction. ¤<<SBAS>>¤ uses a network of ground-based reference stations to measure small variations in the ¤<<GNSS>>¤ satellite signals. Measurements from the reference stations are routed to master stations, which queue the received Deviation Correction (DC) and send the correction messages to geostationary satellites. Those satellites broadcast the correction messages back to Earth, where ¤<<SBAS>>¤-enabled ¤<<GPS>>¤/¤<<GNSS>>¤ receivers use the corrections while computing their positions to improve ¤<<accuracy>>¤. Separate corrections are calculated for ionospheric delay, satellite timing, and satellite orbits (ephemerides), which allows ¤<<error>>¤ corrections to be processed separately, if appropriate, by the user application.

[[anchor-41]]2.6.4.1 Wide Area Augmentation System

The first ¤<<SBAS>>¤ system was ¤<<WAAS>>¤ (Wide Area Augmentation System), which was originally developed to provide improved ¤<<GPS>>¤ ¤<<accuracy>>¤ and a certified level of integrity to the US aviation industry, such as to enable aircraft to conduct ¤<<precision>>¤ approaches to airports and for coastal navigation. It was later expanded to cover Canada and Mexico, providing a consistent coverage over North America.

[[anchor-42]]2.6.4.2 European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service

The European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) was developed as an augmentation system that improves the ¤<<accuracy>>¤ of positions derived from ¤<<GPS>>¤ signals and alerts users about the reliability of the ¤<<GPS>>¤ signals. Originally developed using three geostationary satellites covering European Union member states, EGNOS satellites have now also been placed over the eastern Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the African mid-continent.

[[anchor-43]]2.6.4.3 Other SBAS Services

More recently, other ¤<<SBAS>>¤s have been, or are in the process of being developed to cover other parts of the world, including MSAS (Japan and parts of Asia), GAGAN (India), SDCM (Russia), SNAS (China), AFI (Africa) and SACCSA (South and Central America) (ESA 2014). Australia and New Zealand are in the process of developing an ¤<<SBAS>>¤ system that will provide several decimeter accuracy across Australia and its marine areas, and one decimetre accuracy across New Zealand. The system will provide three services to users - an L1 system with sub one-meter horizontal ¤<<accuracy>>¤ for aviation purposes; a Dual-Frequency Multi-Constellation (DFMC) with sub one-meter ¤<<accuracy,accuracies>>¤; and a Precise Point Position (PPP) service (see <<__*2.6.6 Precise Point Positioning*__>> with ¤<<accuracy,accuracies>>¤ of 10-15 cm (Guan 2019). Testing is scheduled for completion in July 2020 (Geoscience Australia 2019a).

[[anchor-44]]2.6.4.4 Accuracy of SBAS Services

A study in 2016 determined that, over most of the USA, the ¤<<accuracy>>¤ of ¤<<WAAS>>¤-enabled, single-frequency ¤<<GPS>>¤ units was on the order of 1.9 meters at least 95% of the time (FAA 2017). This may be lower in other parts of the world where ¤<<SBAS>>¤ stations are less common. Note that as most ¤<<SBAS>>¤ satellites are geostationary, blocked line of sight towards the equator (southwards in the northern hemisphere, or northwards in the Southern hemisphere) by buildings or heavy canopy cover will reduce the ¤<<accuracy>>¤ of ¤<<SBAS>>¤ correction, Also, during solar storms, the ¤<<accuracy>>¤ deteriorates by a factor of around 2.

Despite early indications that ¤<<WAAS>>¤ can significantly improve positional ¤<<accuracy>>¤ during the most severe period of geomagnetic storms, more recent studies in the USA and Canada have shown that the sparseness of ¤<<WAAS>>¤ stations and ionospheric grids do not lead to a significant improvement. (Skone _& Yousuf_ 2007). With reference stations needing to have separations within 100 km, improvements are only likely in coastal and near coastal areas of North America and Europe in the foreseeable future.

[[anchor-45]]2.6.5 Ground-based Augmentation System

Ground Based Augmentation Systems (GBAS), also known as Local Area Augmentation Systems (LAAS), provide differential corrections and satellite integrity monitoring in conjunction with VHF radio, to link to ¤<<GNSS>>¤ receivers. A GBAS consists of several ¤<<GNSS>>¤ antennas placed at known locations with a central control system and a VHF radio transmitter. GBAS is limited in its coverage and is used mainly for specific applications that require high levels of ¤<<accuracy>>¤, availability and integrity, and is the system largely used for airport navigation systems.

[[anchor-46]]2.6.6 Precise Point Positioning

Precise Point Positioning (PPP) depends on ¤<<GNSS>>¤ satellite clock and orbit corrections, generated from a network of global reference stations to remove ¤<<GNSS>>¤ system ¤<<error>>¤ and provide a high level (decimeter) of positional ¤<<accuracy>>¤. Once the corrections are calculated, they are delivered to the end user via satellite or over the Internet.

Although similar to ¤<<SBAS>>¤ systems (see above), they generally provide a greater ¤<<accuracy>>¤ and have the advantage of providing a single, global reference stream as opposed to the regional nature of an ¤<<SBAS>>¤ system. Whereas ¤<<SBAS>>¤ is free, the use of PPP usually incurs a charge to access the corrections, so it is unlikely that the increased ¤<<accuracy>>¤ of PPP when compared to that of ¤<<SBAS>>¤, will be a consideration for most biological applications.

[[anchor-47]]2.6.7 Static GPS

Static ¤<<GPS>>¤__ __uses high ¤<<precision>>¤__ __instruments and specialist techniques and is generally employed only by surveyors. Surveys conducted in__ __Australia using these techniques reported ¤<<accuracy,accuracies>>¤ in the centimeter range. These techniques are__ __unlikely to be extensively used with biological record collection due to the cost and general lack of__ __requirement for such ¤<<precision>>¤.

[[anchor-48]]2.6.8 Dual and Multi-Frequency GPS

High-end dual and multi-frequency ¤<<GPS>>¤/¤<<GNSS>>¤ devices can bring ¤<<accuracy>>¤ to the centimeter level, and even mm level over the long-term (GPS.gov, 2017). One of the ways this is done is by removing one of the largest contributors to overall satellite ¤<<error>>¤ － ¤<<error>>¤ due to the ionosphere (known as ionosphere ¤<<error>>¤) (Novatel 2015).

[[anchor-49]]2.6.9 Smartphones

*<<GPS>>*-enabled smartphones are typically ¤<<accuracy,accurate>>¤ to within 4.9 m (16 ft.) under open sky, however, their ¤<<accuracy>>¤ worsens near buildings, bridges, and trees (GPS.gov 2017). A study by Tomaštik _et al._ (2017) found that the ¤<<accuracy>>¤ of smartphones in open areas was around 2-4 m. This decreased to 3-11 m in deciduous forest without leaves, and 3-20 m in deciduous forest with leaves. There are reports that the ¤<<accuracy>>¤ in some ¤<<GPS>>¤-enabled smartphones will soon be improved to <1 meter (Moore 2017) and that ¤<<accuracy>>¤ in areas with restricted satellite view within cities will be improved drastically with inbuilt 3D smartphone apps and probabilistic shadow matching (Iland _et al._ 2018). In general, the ¤<<GNSS>>¤ chipsets in smartphones are quite good, and any loss of ¤<<accuracy>>¤ is usually due to the ¤<<data quality,quality>>¤ of the antenna, whose chief failing is due to their poor multipath suppression (Pirazzi _et al._ 2017). In some smartphones where good satellite coverage is unavailable (_e.g._, in cities and forests), the phone may introduce ¤<<error,errors>>¤ from ¤<<bias>>¤ in its internal clock (Pirazzi __et al. __2017), leading to occasional large inaccuracies (A.Arino pers. comm.). Already the technology for better than 1 meter smartphone ¤<<accuracy>>¤ exists, but it is not available to the public due to the difficulty and cost of incorporating the technology into small smartphones (Braun 2019). The ¤<<accuracy,accuracies>>¤ reported in most publications refer to studies in the USA, Europe, coastal Australia, India or Japan where good differential stations are plentiful. More studies are needed to test smartphone ¤<<accuracy,accuracies>>¤ in remote ¤<<location,locations>>¤ and where differential stations are not available.

Smartphone ¤<<GPS>>¤ technology is changing rapidly and there is likely to be new and updated information even before this document is published.

[[anchor-50]]2.6.10 GPS-enabled Cameras

We are not aware of the characteristics of the ¤<<accuracy>>¤ of ¤<<GPS>>¤-enabled cameras, but we expect the ¤<<accuracy>>¤ to be similar to that of smartphones. One study, using three different cameras, showed variation between the three and the true ¤<<location>>¤ to be less than 3 m from the reported ¤<<location>>¤ (Doty 2017). 🐠Note that ¤<<GPS>>¤-enabled cameras that are used for snorkelling and diving activities, will only give new ¤<<GPS>>¤ readings each time the camera is brought to the surface.

[[anchor-51]]2.6.11 Diver-towed Underwater GPS Receivers

🐠Over the years, a number of methods for tracking a diver underwater with a ¤<<GPS>>¤ have been tried with limited success. These included using a floating ¤<<GPS>>¤ receiver over the diver’s bubbles, and a ¤<<GPS>>¤ receiver on a raft towed by the diver that recorded intermittent readings to provide a dive ¤<<transect>>¤ (Schories & Niedzwiedz 2011). The most successful to date has been the use of a ¤<<GPS>>¤ antenna on a floating buoy that is attached by a cable to a diver-held ¤<<GPS>>¤. These diver-towed underwater ¤<<GPS>>¤/¤<<GNSS>>¤ handheld receivers have been used for underwater monitoring studies for several years. Most dives using this method are at <20 meters as the signal deteriorates with cable length giving a maximum practical depth of 50 meters (Niedzwiedz & Schories 2013). One problem is cable drag, and it is almost impossible to determine the buoys ¤<<offset>>¤ exactly although Niedzwiedz & Schories (2013) provide formulae for attempting to do so. A study by the same authors (Schories & Niedzwiedz 2011) showed displacement of 2.3 m at a ¤<<depth>>¤ of 5 m, 3.2 m at 10-m ¤<<depth>>¤, 4.6 m at 20-m ¤<<depth>>¤, 5.5 m at 30-m ¤<<depth>>¤, and 6.8 m at 40-m ¤<<depth>>¤. These are in addition to ¤<<GPS>>¤ ¤<<accuracy>>¤ discussed under <<__*2.6.2 GPS Accuracy*__>>, above.

[[anchor-52]]2.7 Elevation

Supplement the ¤<<locality>>¤ description with ¤<<elevation>>¤ information if this can be easily obtained. ¤<<elevation,Elevation>>¤ can be determined from a variety of sources while in the field, including altimeters, maps (both digital and paper), and ¤<<GPS>>¤/¤<<GNSS>>¤ receivers, each with associated ¤<<uncertainty,uncertainties>>¤. ¤<<elevation,Elevation>>¤ can be estimated _post-facto_ using ¤<<digital elevation model,Digital Elevation Models>>¤ at the ¤<<coordinates>>¤ of the ¤<<location>>¤. In any case, record the method used to determine the ¤<<elevation>>¤.

NOTE: "<<elevation,Elevation>> markings can narrow down the area in which you place a point. More often than not, however, they seem to create inconsistency. While <<elevation>> should not be ignored, it is important to realize that <<elevation>> was often measured <<accuracy,inaccurately>> and/or <<precision,imprecisely>>, especially early in the 20th century. One of the best uses of <<elevation>> in a <<locality>> description is to pinpoint a <<location>> along a road or river in a topographically complex area, especially when the rest of the <<locality>> description is vague." *_(Murphy _et al._ 2004).

When adding ¤<<elevation>>¤ _post facto_ be aware that the ¤<<elevation>>¤ can vary considerably over a small area (especially in steep terrain) and that the ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ of the ¤<<georeference>>¤ must be taken into account when determining the ¤<<elevation>>¤. Do not use the ¤<<coordinates>>¤ on their own.

[[anchor-53]]2.7.1 Altimeters

A barometric altimeter uses changes in air pressure as a proxy for changes in ¤<<elevation>>¤, and can be a reliable source of ¤<<elevation>>¤ if properly calibrated. Calibration requires that the ¤<<elevation>>¤ of the altimeter be set to a known starting ¤<<elevation>>¤, which could be determined from a map, for example. Thereafter, as the altimeter goes higher or lower in ¤<<elevation>>¤, it estimates the new ¤<<elevation>>¤ directly from the air pressure it experiences. Since weather conditions can change the air pressure independently of changes in ¤<<elevation>>¤, it is important to re-calibrate the altimeter frequently, either by recording the ¤<<elevation>>¤ when you stop moving and resetting to that same ¤<<elevation>>¤ before starting out again, and/or by recalibrating to known ¤<<elevations>>¤ whenever you encounter them.

In theory it would be possible to use a barometric altimeter to determine ¤<<elevations>>¤ when in a 🐉subterranean ¤<<location>>¤ (cave, mine, etc.), but these situations are particularly prone to changes in air pressure independent from ¤<<elevation>>¤ changes (especially in caves with narrow openings), so recalibration would have to be particularly careful.

[[anchor-54]]2.7.2 Maps

**<<e**levation,**Elevation>> **can be determined using the contours and spot height information from a suitable scale map of the area. In general, the ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ in the ¤<<elevation>>¤ when read from a map is half the contour interval.

For information on determining accuracy from a map, see <<__*3.4.2.1 *__https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eooUGqT0wu7unzCvg5TOrfhHToYUrRCgmg36HmPgxII/edit#heading=h.vu2q3vfjht3[_*Uncertainty *_]__*in Paper Map Measurements*__>>.

[[anchor-55]]2.7.3 GPS

**<<e**levation,*Elevation>> <<accuracy>>* as reported from a ¤<<GPS>>¤ has improved markedly in recent years, but ¤<<elevation>> <<accuracy>>¤ is not usually reported by ¤<<GPS>>¤/¤<<GNSS>>¤ receivers. As a general rule, for most non-¤<<SBAS>>¤ or ¤<<WAAS>>¤ enabled ¤<<GPS>>¤/¤<<GNSS>>¤ receivers, <<**elevation>> <<error>> **is approximately 2-3 times the horizontal ¤<<error>>¤ (USGS 2017). It is hard to find definitive information for smartphones, but it would appear that this same multiplier is a good rule for those as well. With ¤<<WAAS>>¤-enabled ¤<<GPS>>¤, the FAA reports that 95% of the time vertical error is <4 meters (FAA 2019). However, the ¤<<elevation>>¤ reported on the ¤<<GPS>>¤ receiver or smartphone is not necessarily referring to ¤<<mean sea level>>¤ (MSL) as reported, but to the zero elevation of the ¤<<ellipsoid>>¤ of the ¤<<datum>>¤ - see discussion below.

Note that <<**GPS>> <<elevation>> **readings can represent one of at least two different values, depending on the method used by the ¤<<GPS>>¤. **<e**levation,**Elevation>> **reported can be the geometric height. This is the only value that ¤<<GPS>>¤ devices can actually measure, and is the height based on the ¤<<ellipsoid>>¤ of the ¤<<datum>>¤. The ¤<<elevation>>¤ reported can also be the ¤<<elevation>>¤ above ¤<<mean sea level>>¤ (MSL), or orthometric height. These values are not directly measured by the ¤<<GPS>>¤, but are calculated as the difference between the geometric height (measured) and the ¤<<geoid>>¤ height. The ¤<<geoid>>¤ height depends on the ¤<<geoid>>¤ and the ¤<<datum>>¤ you are trying to compare it against. Thus, to understand the potential difference between ¤<<elevation,elevations>>¤ based on ¤<<mean sea level>>¤ and those based on the geometric model, the geometric model (¤<<datum>>¤) must be known. To calculate the potential ¤error¤ using ¤<<WGS84>>¤ ¤<<datum>>¤ at a given geographic ¤<<location>>¤, use the https://www.unavco.org/software/geodetic-utilities/geoid-height-calculator/geoid-height-calculator.html[_Geoid Height Calculator_] (UNAVCO 2020). For further discussion about these methods, consult Eos Positioning Systems (2018). For a good explanation of the differences between the ¤<<geoid>>¤ and ¤<<mean sea level>>¤, we refer you to GISGeography (2019).

[[anchor-56]]2.7.4 Vertical Datums

In 2022, the USA will release a new geometric reference frame and geopotential ¤<<vertical datum>>¤ that will replace existing USA geometric ¤<<vertical datums>>¤. Similarly, over the next five years, Australia will move to a new generation height reference frame - the Australian Gravimetric Quasigeoid 2017 (AGQG 2017) (McCubbine _et al._ 2019). The new reference frames will rely primarily on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (¤<<GNSS>>¤), as well as on an updated gravimetric ¤<<geoid>>¤ model (National Geodetic Survey 2018). The new method of calculating ¤<<vertical datum,vertical datums>>¤ will improve vertical ¤<<accuracy,accuracies>>¤ to around 1-2 cm, will provide more ¤<<accuracy,accurate>>¤ ¤<<GPS>>¤-determined <<elevation,*elevations>> *(Ellingson 2017), and will allow for dynamic updating. Other jurisdictions are likely to move to new methods of calculating ¤<<vertical datum,vertical datums>>¤ over time, meaning that within 5 years most users will be able to vertically position themselves using mobile Global Navigation Satellite Systems (¤<<GNSS>>¤) technology with sub-decimetre ¤<<accuracy>>¤ (Brown _et al._ 2019).

[[anchor-57]]2.7.5 Digital Elevation Models

¤<<digital elevation model,Digital Elevation Models>>¤ (DEM) are based on ¤<<elevation,elevations>>¤ above ¤<<mean sea level>>¤ (or more recently, the ¤<<geoid>>¤). The models are calculated using sophisticated interpolations and do not necessarily correspond to the actual surface ¤<<elevation>>¤. ¤<<digital elevation model,DEM>>¤ vertical ¤<<accuracy>>¤ is influenced by several factors such as ¤<<grid>>¤ size, slope, land cover, and geolocation (horizontal) ¤<<error>>¤, as well as other ¤<<bias,biases>>¤ due to the original ¤<<digital elevation model,DEM>>¤ data collection (_e.g._, satellite imaging geometry) and/or production method (Mukherjee _et al._ 2013, Mouratidis and Ampatzidis 2019). Global ¤<<digital elevation model,DEMs>>¤ such as the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Global DEM V2 (Meyer 2011) and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) are based on 1 arc-second grids (about 30 m x 30 m) (Farr _et al._ 2007) and have an ¤<<accuracy>>¤ of better than 17 m and 10 m respectively (except for in steep terrain such as mountains, and areas with very smooth sandy surfaces with low signal to noise ratio, such as the Sahara Desert (Farr _et al._ 2007)). Local and regional ¤<<digital elevation model,DEMs>>¤ may have a smaller ¤<<grid>>¤ size. For example, a 5 m ¤<<grid>>¤ in Australia, which has a vertical ¤<<accuracy>>¤ better than one meter, and even to 0.3 meter in some areas (Geoscience Australia 2018) or the European Digital Elevation Model, which has an ¤<<accuracy>>¤ of better than three meters (Mouratidis and Ampatzidis 2019). Note also that satellite image-based ¤<<digital elevation model,DEMs>>¤, being radar based, vary greatly over different land surfaces, forests, shrub or herbaceous vegetation, agricultural areas, bare areas, rocky surfaces, wetlands, and artificial surfaces such as cities. Also the radar can penetrate into areas of snow, ice, and sand (as in deserts) (Mouratidis and Ampatzidis 2019).

[[anchor-58]]2.7.6 Smartphones

Some smartphones, whether they incorporate ¤<<GPS>>¤ capabilities or not, use apps that provide ¤<<elevation>>¤ values based on a ¤<<digital elevation model,DEM>>¤. With smartphone ¤<<GPS>>¤ apps, be aware that some devices and apps incorrectly record the method used. The ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ in ¤<<elevation>>¤ due to an unknown ¤<<elevation>>¤ source can be up to 100 m. For example, the difference with <<**datum>> <<WGS84>> **between the ¤<<ellipsoid>>¤ and ¤<<geoid>>¤ or ¤<<mean sea level>>¤ methods of reporting ¤<<elevation>>¤ is shown in <<Figure 8>>. Note also that these ¤<<uncertainty,uncertainties>>¤ are in addition to the ¤<<uncertainty,uncertainties>>¤ associated with the measurements themselves. The only true way of determining what your ¤<<GPS>>¤ receiver or smartphone is recording is to test it against a known ¤<<elevation>>¤. Some preliminary studies by the authors show <<**elevation>> <<accuracy>> **from ¤<<smartphones>>¤ varies greatly in different areas of the world. In areas in the USA, Europe, Australia, Japan, etc. (where most published results are from) ¤<<error,errors>>¤ are generally within 10 meters or so, but in more remote areas (such as on a remote island in Fiji), ¤<<error,errors>>¤ in the order of +/- 60 meters are not uncommon. Using two different mobile applications at sea level at one location resulted in reported ¤<<elevation,elevations>>¤ from -24 m to +58.9 m. These studies are preliminary and more research is needed in different areas of the world.

[[anchor-59]]2.7.7 Google Earth™

Using a large sample size (n>20,000) of ¤<<GPS>>¤ benchmarks in a variety of terrains in the United States, Wang _et al._ (2017) found that ¤<<elevation,elevations>>¤ in the Google Earth™ terrain model had a boundary of ¤<<error>>¤ interval at 95% (BE95) of __+__44 m, with worst-case scenarios around 200 m. The same study found that Google Earth™ terrain model had a BE95 of __+__6 m along highways. Though we find no data for elsewhere in the world at this time, we recommend using the values extracted from the work of Wang _et al_. as estimates of ¤<<elevation,elevational>> <<uncertainty>>¤ when the source is the Google Earth™ terrain model. A second study using Google Earth™ to determine ¤<<elevation>>¤ in three regions of Egypt (El-Ashmawy 2016) on flat, medium, and steep terrains concluded that ¤<<elevation>>¤ data is more ¤<<accuracy,accurate>>¤ in flat areas or areas with small height difference, with an ¤<<accuracy>>¤ of approximately 1.85 m (RMSE) and an ¤<<error>>¤ range of less than 3.72 m (and in some findings less than 1 m). Increasing the difference in height leads to decrease in the obtained ¤<<accuracy>>¤ with the RMSE rising to 5.69 m in steep terrain.

[[anchor-60]]2.8 Headings

Compass directions (also known as <<heading,*headings>>)* can be rather ambiguous. North, for example, might be any direction between northwest and northeast if more specific information is not provided. There are several ways to avoid ambiguity when recording ¤<<heading,headings>>¤. One way is to qualify the direction with "due" (_e.g._, "due north") if the ¤<<heading>>¤ warrants it. A second way to avoid ambiguity is to use two orthogonal ¤<<heading,headings>>¤ in ¤<<locality>>¤ descriptions, making implicit that both components are "due". Finally, ambiguity can be reduced if ¤<<heading,headings>>¤ are given in degrees from north (0° is north, 90° is east, 180° is south, and 270° is west).

It is important to record ¤<<heading,headings>>¤ based on True North (true ¤<<heading>>¤) and not on Magnetic North (magnetic ¤<<heading>>¤). The differences between True North and Magnetic North vary throughout the world, and in some places can vary greatly across a very small distance (NOAA 2019, NOAA/NCEI & CIRES 2019). For example, in an area about 250 km NW of Minneapolis in the United States, the anomalous ¤<<magnetic declination>>¤ (the difference between the ¤<<magnetic declination,declination>>¤ caused by the Earth's outer core and the ¤<<magnetic declination,declination>>¤ at the surface) changes from 16.6° E to 12.0° W across a distance of just 6 km (Goulet 2001).

[[anchor-61]]The differences between True North and Magnetic North also change over time (NOAA _n.dat_.a). The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has an online calculator (https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/calculators/magcalc.shtml[_https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/calculators/magcalc.shtml_]) that can calculate the anomalous or geomagnetic <<magnetic declination,*declination>> *(adjustment needed to convert the magnetic reading to a reading based on True North) for any place on earth and at any point in time. If you need to make adjustments, we suggest that you use this calculator to determine the ¤<<magnetic declination>>¤ for the area in question. Otherwise determine your ¤<<heading>>¤ using a reliable map and always report your methods. Note that some smartphone apps will make that calculation for you, and allow you to set your app to record either Magnetic North or True North.

[[anchor-62]]2.9 Offsets

An ¤<<offset>>¤ is a displacement from a reference point, named place, or other ¤<<feature>>¤, and is generally accompanied by a direction (or ¤<<heading>>¤, see <<__*2.8 Headings*__>>). One of the best ways to describe a ¤<<locality>>¤ is with orthogonal ¤<<offset,offsets>>¤ from a small, persistent, easy to locate ¤<<feature>>¤ (see <<__*2.2 Localities*__>>). Using an ¤<<offset>>¤ at a very specific ¤<<heading>>¤ is a second option, though the ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ still grows with the ¤<<offset>>¤ distance. ¤<<offset,Offsets>>¤ along a ¤<<path>>¤ are a third reasonable option for describing a ¤<<locality>>¤, though they tend to be much harder to measure _post-facto_. Other ¤<<locality type,locality types>>¤ that use <<offset,*offsets>> *(_e.g._, an ¤<<offset>>¤ ¤<<direction>>¤ without a distance, or an ¤<<offset>>¤ distance without a ¤<<direction>>¤) tend to introduce excessive ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ and should be avoided.

[[anchor-63]]2.9.1 Offset Distance Only

A ¤<<locality>>¤ consisting of an ¤<<offset>>¤ from a ¤<<feature>>¤ without a ¤<<heading>>¤ may arise as a result of an ¤<<error>>¤ when recording the ¤<<locality>>¤ in the field or through data entry. If the ¤<<feature>>¤ is small (such as a ¤<<trig point>>¤) then the overall ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ will be largely due to the ¤<<offset>>¤. With larger <<feature,*features>> *(such as a town, or a lake), both the ¤<<offset>>¤ from, and the ¤<<extent>>¤ of the ¤<<feature>>¤ may contribute significantly to the overall ¤<<uncertainty>>¤. The original collection catalogs or labels may contain information that can make the *locality* more specific. If not, a *"Distance only" locality* (_e.g._, "5 km from Lake Vättern, Sweden" might be envisioned as a band running around the reference **feature** at a distance given in the *locality* description. The problem is, we don't know what was being used at the reference - some place in the lake, or some place on the edge, nor do we know if the ¤<<offset>>¤ was perpendicular to an edge or at some oblique angle to it. Because of these confounding factors, it is recommended to treat the ¤<<locality>>¤ as if it was a *feature* enlarged on all sides by the combination of all the sources of ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ (see <<__*2.2.1 Offset - Distance only*__>> in __*Georeferencing *__Q_*uick Reference Guide*_ (Zermoglio _et al_ 2020)).

[[anchor-64]]2.9.2 Offset Direction Only

A ¤<<locality>>¤ with a ¤<<heading>>¤ from a *feature*, but with no distance (_e.g._, "East of Albuquerque"), is particularly ambiguous and very subjective to *georeference*. With no additional information to constrain the distance , there is no clear indication of how far one might have to go to reach the *location *– to the next nearest *feature*; the next nearest *feature* of equivalent size, to a place where there is a major change in biome (such as a coast), or just keep going?

Note that seldom is such ¤<<locality>>¤ information given alone. For example, the ¤<<locality>>¤ may have administrative geography information (_e.g._, ‘East of Albuquerque, Bernalillo County, New Mexico’). This gives you a stopping point (_e.g._, the county border), and should allow you to **georeference** the ¤<<locality>>¤ (see <<__*2.2.2 Offset - Heading only*__>>) in __*Georeferencing *__Q_*uick Reference Guide*_ (Zermoglio _et al._ 2020). In any case, it is highly recommended not to record locality descriptions in this way.

[[anchor-65]]2.9.3 Offset at a Heading

A **locality** that contains an ¤<<offset>>¤ in a given direction to or from a ¤<<feature>>¤ is treated here as an "offset at a ¤<<heading>>¤". There are several variations on such *localities*. One difficulty in determining a ¤<<georeference>>¤ for this type of ¤<<locality>>¤ description is knowing how the ¤<<offset>>¤ was determined - for example, by air, or along a ¤<<path>>¤ such as a road or river. Therefore, whenever a locality with an ¤<<offset>>¤ at a ¤<<heading>>¤ is described, be sure to be explicit about what is intended.

It is not uncommon for 🐠marine ¤<<locality>>¤ descriptions to use an azimuth - a ¤<<heading>>¤ toward a target ¤<<feature>>¤, for example, "25° to Waipapa Point Lighthouse". In these cases the referenced ¤<<feature>>¤ is the starting point, and the ¤<<heading>>¤ from there should be 180 degrees on the compass away from the compass reading given in the ¤<<locality>>¤ description. This is known as a "back azimuth" or "backsighting".

Where the sense of the ¤<<offset>>¤ cannot be determined from the ¤<<locality>>¤ description or additional information and there is no obvious major ¤<<path>>¤ that can be followed in the rough direction and distance given, then it is best to assume the collector measured the distance by air. Whatever the decision, document the assumption in the ¤<<georeference>>¤ remarks (_e.g._, ‘Assumed "by air" – no roads E out of Yuma’, or ‘Assumed "by road" on Hwy. 80’) and ¤<<georeference>>¤ accordingly (see <<__*2.2.5 Offset - Distance at a Heading*__>> and <<__*2.2.3 Offset - Distance along a Path*__>> in __*Georeferencing *__Q_*uick Reference Guide*_ (Zermoglio _et al._ 2020).

The addition of an adverbial modifier to the distance part of a ¤<<locality>>¤ description (such as "about 25 km"), while an honest observation, should not affect the determination of the ¤<<geographic coordinates>>¤ or the ¤<<maximum uncertainty distance,maximum uncertainty>>¤. Treat the <<**uncertainty>**> due to distance ¤<<precision>>¤ normally (see <<link:#_tbb3wgkuhzeh[_*3.4.6 Uncertainty Related to Offset Precision*_]>>)

[[anchor-66]]2.9.4 Offset along a Path

Sometimes it is convenient to describe a ¤<<locality>>¤ as a distance along a curvilinear ¤<<feature>>¤ — a ¤<<path>>¤ such as a road, river, trail, etc. (see <<__*2.2.3 Offset - Distance along a Path*__>> in __*Georeferencing *__Q_*uick Reference Guide *_(Zermoglio _et al_. 2020). One advantage of a description of this kind is that it avoids the ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ due to an ¤<<precision,imprecise>>¤ ¤<<heading>>¤. It might also be easy to register, such as when tracking distance with the odometer of a car while driving. However, a disadvantage is that it may not be quite as easy to determine the same ¤<<location>>¤ _post-facto_ from maps alone during the ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ process, because it means you have to trace the facsimile of the ¤<<path>>¤ on the map, which may have ¤<<error,errors>>¤, loss of resolution due to map scale, or inconsistencies with conditions at the time of the ¤<<event>>¤, or might not even be present. Also, the ¤<<path>>¤ may have changed over time, making it even more difficult to find the exact ¤<<locality>>¤ retrospectively**. **

If the ¤<<locality>>¤ references a river, such as in the example "16 mi downstream from St Louis on the left bank of the Mississippi River", it is reasonable to assume that the ¤<<offset>>¤ is along the river. In this example, the ¤<<locality>>¤ is on the east side of the river, in Illinois, rather than on the west side, in Missouri, as the reference to "left bank" is conventionally taken to be in the orientation looking downstream.

[[anchor-67]]2.9.5 Offset along Orthogonal Directions

This type of ¤<<locality>>¤ refers to rectilinear distances in two orthogonal ¤<<direction,directions>>¤ from a ¤<<feature>>¤, for example, "2 mi E and 1.5 mi N of Kandy" (see <<__*2.2.4 Offset - Distance along Orthogonal Directions*__>> in Georeferencing Q__*uick Reference Guide *__(Zermoglio _et al_. 2020) and <<Figure 12>>. This way of describing a locality can be very effective, as it tends to remove one of the potentially largest sources of *uncertainty*, the ever-expanding ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ of ¤<<direction>>¤ with distance. Using orthogonal ¤<<direction,directions>>¤ removes all ¤<<direction,directional>>¤ ¤<<uncertainty>>¤, as orthogonality implies directly in the orthogonal ¤<<direction,directions>>¤ "by air". It is for this reason that this ¤<<locality type>>¤ is highly recommended for ¤<<locality>>¤ descriptions.

[[anchor-68]]2.10 Water Depth

Water ¤<<depth>>¤ should be recorded as a range; _i.e_., as minimum and maximum positive distances in meters below the air-water interface of the water body (🐠ocean, sea, lake, river, etc.). Maximum ¤<<depth>>¤ will always be a positive number greater than or equal to the minimum ¤<<depth>>¤. If the ¤<<depth>>¤ measurement is specific rather than a range, use the same value for the minimum and maximum ¤<<depth,depths>>¤.

[[anchor-69]]2.10.1 Bathymetry

🐠The ¤<<depth>>¤ of the benthic surface in large water bodies is called ¤<<bathymetry>>¤ or bathymetric ¤<<depth>>¤. It is usually recorded in one of two ways - as a gridded surface (Digital Terrain Model), or as contours. The accuracy of the ¤<<bathymetry>>¤ depends on how it was determined, and is generally much more ¤<<accuracy,accurate>>¤ near the coasts, or in harbours, than it is in the deeper ocean.

Since 2003, the most commonly used global coverage of ¤<<bathymetry>>¤ has been the One Minute General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO 2019a), however, in 2019, a much finer, and more detailed, 15 arc-second ¤<<grid>>¤ coverage was released (GEBCO 2019b). The 3,732,480,000 *grids *(86,400 rows by 43,200 columns) cover from 89°59'52.5'' N, 179°59'52.5'' W to 89°59'52.5'' S, 179°59'52.5'' E, with ¤<<elevation>>¤ given for each pixel center. There are many criteria that determine the vertical ¤<<accuracy>>¤ of these ¤<<grid,grids>>¤, including the presence of steep canyons, water ¤<<depth>>¤ and turbidity (affects instrument penetration and acoustic beams get wider, the deeper they go), and methodology (satellite, single beam echo sounders (SES), multibeam echo sounders (MES), airborne laser (LADS), Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), etc.) (Wolf __et al. __2019).

**<**<bathymetry,**Bathymetric>> **contours have generally only been available for harbours, coastal and near inshore areas, in some places extending to the edges of the continental slope. Where ¤<<bathymetry,bathymetric>>¤ contours (also called ¤<<depth>>¤ contours or isobaths) do exist, they are generally quite coarse (except in areas like the North Sea, and in harbours), and get wider apart as the depth increases. For example, the 2009 ¤<<bathymetry,bathymetric>>¤ contours for Australia are at 20 m, 40 m, 100 m, 200 m and 400 m. In some harbours, the contour interval is as small as one meter (Data.gov.au 2018). In 2019, the GEBCO_2019 global ¤<<bathymetry,bathymetric>>¤ contour dataset was derived from the GEBCO_2019 15 arc-second grid mentioned above. At large scales (1:5,000,000 and closer), the contour interval is 500 m; at medium scales (1:5,000,000 to 1:30,000,000) the contour interval is 1000 m; and at small scales (1:30,000,000 and greater), the contour interval is 2000 m. Supplementary contours are shown in shallow waters (less than 500 m) (NCEI-NOAA 2019).

Very few studies have been carried out on the ¤<<accuracy>>¤ of either the ¤<<bathymetry,bathymetric>>¤ ¤<<grid,grids>>¤ or contours - especially with GEBCO_2019 as the dataset has only recently been published. The authors have not been able to find any definitive information on ¤<<accuracy,accuracies>>¤ that we can report on a general basis, but the contour intervals give an indication of the ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ inherent in the ¤<<grid,grids>>¤. In coastal, near inshore areas, harbours, and inland reservoirs and lakes, more intensive and different ¤<<bathymetry,bathymetric>>¤ surveys have generally been carried out (see the Bathymetric Data Viewer (NOAA 2019)) and **accuracy** studies have been conducted in some of these areas. In shallow-water areas there is less interference due to water ¤<<depth>>¤ and higher sound wave frequencies can be used for multibeam ¤<<bathymetry,bathymetric>>¤ surveying. The ¤<<accuracy>>¤ is much better than in other deeper-water areas, and thus these studies cannot be extrapolated to the broader ocean. For contours, as with land maps, ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ in the ¤<<elevation>>¤ is half the contour interval.

[[anchor-70]]2.10.2 Dive Computers

There are three methods for determining ¤<<depth>>¤ that are generally used by divers, _i.e._, dive computers, dive watches and depth gauges. All work on ambient pressure to determine the ¤<<depth>>¤. Dive computers need to be calibrated before dives and set depending on the water density - _i.e.,_ saltwater or freshwater, etc. and if calibrated correctly are reported by manufacturers, to be ¤<<accuracy,accurate>>¤ to within 0.3 m.

A study of 47 brands of dive computers at ¤<<depth,depths>>¤ of 10 m, 20 m, 30 m, 40 m and 50 m in both seawater and freshwater showed that the majority of ¤<<depth>>¤ estimates were in the ± 1 meter range, and that if the salinity is known and the instrument is properly calibrated, ¤<<accuracy,accuracies>>¤ of around 1% could or should be expected (Azzopardi & Sayer 2012). The ¤<<accuracy>>¤ of diver-held depth gauges are of a similar order. Dive watches are generally thought less ¤<<accuracy,accurate>>¤, but with reports for some watches of ¤<<depth>>¤ ¤<<accuracy>>¤, at ¤<<depth,depths>>¤ of up to 100 m, as ± 1% of displayed value + 0.3 m (when used at constant temperature). ¤<<accuracy,Accuracy>>¤ can be influenced by changes in ambient temperature and water salinity.

[[anchor-71]]2.11 Distance above Surface

¤<<distance above surface,Distance above surface>>¤ should be recorded in meters in a vertical direction from a reference point, with a minimum and a maximum distance to cover a range. Examples include the height above the ground of a soaring eagle, the distance up a tree from the ground (height), and the distance from the top of a vertical core sample to a diatom sample found in that core.

The reference point for the measurement of a ¤<<distance above surface>>¤ can vary depending on the context. For surface terrestrial locations, the reference point should be the ¤<<elevation>>¤ at ground level. For water bodies (🐠ocean, sea, lake, river, etc.), the reference point for aerial locations should be the ¤<<elevation>>¤ of the air-water interface, while the reference point for 🐠sub-surface benthic locations should be the bottom of the water body at that ¤<<location>>¤. <<location,**Locations> **within the water body should use water ¤<<depth>>¤ and should not use any other distance above a surface.

We recommend that ¤<<distance above surface>>¤ always be measured in the same sense, that is, as distances _above_ the reference surface. Distances above a reference point should be expressed as positive numbers, while those below should be negative. This is analogous to ¤<<elevation>>¤, which is positive when expressing a distance above ¤<<mean sea level>>¤ and negative below that reference point. The maximum ¤<<distance above surface>>¤ will always be a number greater than or equal to the minimum distance above that surface for a given ¤<<location>>¤ (see <<Figure 9>>).

For the special case of recording ¤<<location,locations>>¤ within a 🐉cave system or in an underground mine, see <<__*2.12 Caves*__>>__*.*__

[[anchor-72]]2.12 Caves

🐉Collecting in caves, underground mines and tunnels presents a number of challenges not encountered elsewhere.

[[anchor-73]]2.12.1 Determining location

In 🐉cave systems and underground mines, determining the geographic position on the surface (known as ¤<<ground zero>>¤) can be done with radiolocation or Electromagnetic Cave-to-Surface (ECMS) Mapping System (Sogade __et al. __2004), which uses electromagnetic wave technology. This requires a levelled radio loop in the ¤<<location>>¤ within the cave and a receiver above ground to determine the *location* underground. The surface <**location>> **can then be determined using a ¤<<GPS>>¤/¤<<GNSS>>¤ receiver, as usual. With a levelled antenna, an experienced operator can determine a ¤<<ground zero>>¤ with an¤<<accuracy>>¤ of one meter for a 50 m depth (2%) (Gibson 1996, 2002), however, more recent radiolocation beacons have increased the horizontal ¤<<accuracy>>¤ to about 0.5% to 1% (Goldsheider & Drew 2014, Buecher 2016). Fortunately, many caves and mines have already been extensively mapped, so where maps are available, these may be used to determine ¤<<location,locations>>¤.

A second method, using the cave mouth, is probably more commonly used, is easier to determine, but is less ¤<<accuracy,accurate>>¤ and has a much greater ¤<<uncertainty>>¤. The cave mouth, tunnel opening, mine shaft entrance, etc., are the most obvious ¤<<location,locations>>¤ to begin with. These ¤<<location,locations>>¤ can easily be obtained using a ¤<<GPS>>¤ unit, but be aware of the likely reduced ¤<<accuracy>>¤ of the ¤<<GPS>>¤ unit if the cave entrance is within a deep valley where good ¤<<GNSS>>¤ reception may be reduced. It is documenting the <**location>> **of the ¤<<event>>¤ from that position that is much more difficult, especially where detailed cave maps don’t exist. At its crudest level, one may estimate the cave ¤<<extent>>¤ and determine the ¤<<corrected center>>¤ of that ¤<<extent>>¤. From there you can determine a ¤<<geographic radial>>¤ as noted elsewhere in this document (see <<__*2.3.3 Polygons*__>>. Just recording the ¤<<location>>¤ of the cave entrance, and using a large ¤<<radial,radius>>¤ for the ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ is not ideal but may be a last resort. If doing this however, make sure that your ¤<<locality>>¤ description includes as much additional information as possible - such as estimated distance from the cave entrance, ¤<<direction>>¤, and if possible, a ‘depth’. For ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ in Caves, see <<__*2.1.3.5 Feature - Cave*__>> in Zermoglio _et al._ (2020).

[[anchor-74]]2.12.2 Elevation

Traditionally, cavers have recorded the depth in a 🐉cave as the depth below the surface, however, in this document and for the purposes of recording biological observations, we use ¤<<elevation>>¤ (above ¤<<mean sea level>>¤ or ¤<<geoid>>¤) for a position at the floor of the cave.

The distance below ¤<<ground zero>>¤ can be determined using the same radiolocation equipment as for determining the ¤<<ground zero>>¤ itself (see above). The ¤<<accuracy>>¤ of the distance below ¤<<ground zero>>¤, calculated using these methods is around 5-10% (Gibson 1996, 2002) for depths up to about 50 meters. As above, however, recent beacons have improved the ¤<<accuracy>>¤ to about 10% for depths of up to 300 meters below the surface (NOT Engineers 2019). Uneven surface terrain can add to the ¤<<uncertainty,uncertainties>>¤ by up to a further 3% and in very deep caves, mines, etc. where there are heavy ore bodies present, and where there are fault lines, this method is far less reliable for determining depth with ¤<<error,errors>>¤ increasing up to 20%. In those conditions radiolocation may not be suitable for determining the distance below the surface.

From these figures, it is possible to determine the ¤<<elevation>>¤ of the floor of the cave by taking the ¤<<elevation>>¤ at ¤<<ground zero>>¤ and deducting the calculated distance below that point (see <<Figure 10>>). Note that when determining ¤<<elevation>>¤ in a cave, the ¤<<accuracy>>¤ mentioned above is additional to the <<**elevation>> <<uncertainty>> **determined for the ¤<<elevation>>¤ at ¤<<ground zero>>¤.

Using detailed cave maps may provide a better (and cheaper) alternative to other methods, and you should choose the best method for your purpose, but be sure to document how the ¤<<elevation>>¤ was determined. Cave maps can usually be obtained by contacting local speleological or cave clubs.

*Figure 10.* Specifying the vertical position of a ¤<<location>>¤ in a cave using an ¤<<elevation>>¤ (*e*) and a ¤<<distance above surface>>¤ (*X*). The ¤<<location>>¤ (*a*) is at a vertical distance (*X*) directly above the floor of the cave, which is at ¤<<elevation>>¤ *e*. The ¤<<elevation>>¤ of **e** is determined within the cave by surveying from a known ¤<<elevation>>¤ on the cave floor (*e1*), which is calculated using an estimated distance below the surface ¤<<elevation>>¤ at ¤<<ground zero>>¤ (*GZ*).

[[anchor-75]]2.12.3 Depth in Subterranean Water Bodies

The water ¤<<depth>>¤ within a subterranean water body (lake, river, sinkhole, etc.) is recorded as for other water bodies and is measured from the surface of the water body (see <<Figure 9>>B). The ¤<<elevation>>¤ of the surface of the water body is determined as for the floor of the cave in <<Figure 10>>.

[[anchor-76]]2.12.4 Distance Above or Below a Surface

Determining the ¤<<distance above surface,distance above>>¤ (and below) a <<distance above surface,*surface>> *(as documented elsewhere) is treated the same within a 🐉cave system (see <<Figure 9, Figure 9B>>, <<Figure 10>>). As above, the ¤<<elevation>>¤ of the cave floor has been determined, so a troglobiont (_e.g._, an animal) on the roof of the cave is given as meters above the floor of the cave whose ¤<<elevation>>¤ has been determined as above ("X" in <<Figure 10>>).

[[anchor-77]]2.13 Dealing with Non-natural Occurrences

Records of non-natural occurrences such as cultivated plants and captive animals, and records resulting from 🐠beach drift or having been washed ashore (such as shells on a beach that do not contain live animals) should have their "non-natural" or "non-wild" provenance recorded. There may be many valuable uses for these records even if the ¤<<location,locations>>¤ do not correspond to natural occurrences of the organisms. We recommend that the ¤<<location>>¤ be recorded and ¤<<georeference,georeferenced>>¤, along with the nature of the provenance (cultivated, captive, washed ashore, etc.).

[[anchor-78]]2.14 Absences and Non-Detections

An ‘absence’ is when a particular detection protocol, implemented at a particular location and time, does not result in a detection. True absence occurs in areas where the environmental conditions are unsuitable for a species’ survival. Recording of absences has always been contentious. This is partly because it is very much a result of subjective interpretation and it can not be vouchered. There are three important and overlapping factors - ¤<<location>>¤, time and methodology. An annual plant, for example, may not be present as an individual at the time of an observation, but may be present at a different time of the year. The <**location>> **needs to be bounded, and is closely linked to the methodology. ¤<<uncertainty,Uncertainty>>¤ of the <**location>> **applies as elsewhere in this document. However, it may have additional implications. Though an observation may record that species x was not detected at a particular <**location>>** at a particular time using a particular methodology, that <**location>>** has an ¤<<uncertainty>>¤. The ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ is saying that the area within which the observation (non-detection) was made is somewhere within the ¤<<radial,radius>>¤ or ¤<<shape>>¤ defined by that ¤<<uncertainty>>¤. It does NOT mean that the absence can be ascribed to the totality of the area described by that ¤<<uncertainty>>¤.

There are many methodologies by which an observer may ascribe an absence. Each of these methodologies will have an additional methodological ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ associated with it, which is important to record, as it may determine the fitness of that non-detection for a particular use. For example, if you took observations every 10 meters along a ¤<<transect>>¤, and the species was not detected at any of those locations, to what extent can you ascribe an absence to the area covered by the ¤<<transect>>¤? Another methodology may be related to the expertise of the observer. If an expert was intensely searching an area for a species, but at the same time noticed that they hadn’t seen any records of a closely related species, which they would have noticed if it was present - what level of certainty can be given to the surmised observation that the second species is absent from the area?

It is thus important to document:

* The ¤<<location>>¤ as discussed elsewhere in this document.
* The area covered by the non-detection.
* The time, duration, and date.
* The methodology used.

[[anchor-79]]2.15 Remotely Captured Data

🌳Counts of animals or plants may be made remotely - for example using an aircraft utilizing direct counts by individuals or using camera or video equipment that is then analysed back in the laboratory. Examples include aerial counts of kangaroos, counts of whales at sea, etc. It may also include the capture of information from 🐠trawls, whereby one or more ships catch marine organisms along one or more ¤<<path,paths>>¤ over a given period (for example, a day) and then the catch is analysed back on shore. Another example is the use of tracking instruments on birds or turtles, etc. that may give either periodic or intermittent reports of ¤<<location>>¤. Other examples are the use of satellites to remotely image penguins in the Antarctic and then use either individual researchers or machines to count the individual penguins from the satellite image and counts of caribou in the arctic using aerial photography.

In many of these examples, the count of the number of individuals within an area is the aim, rather than the ¤<<location>>¤ of individual organisms. This may be recorded as a ¤<<grid>>¤, a polygon, a ¤<<path>>¤, or a line. Record the ¤<<location>>¤, its ¤<<extent>>¤, and the ¤<<geographic radial>>¤ for the ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ as described for these same ¤<<geometry,geometries>>¤ in the preceding subsections.

[[anchor-80]]2.16 Data for Small Labels

An issue that often arises with insect collections is the challenge of recording ¤<<locality>>¤ information on small labels. This should not be as big an issue as previously, because new technologies allow for linking information on the label to a database (through barcodes, or QR codes, etc.) with the recording of only basic information on the label. See Wheeler _et al._ (2001) on guidelines for preparing labels for terrestrial arthropods, but bear in mind the principles laid out in this document when preparing data for insect labels, especially the recording of <<**datum>>, <<coordinate reference system>> **or ¤<<EPSG>>¤ codes, etc., which are not covered by Wheeler _et al._

[[anchor-81]]2.17 Documentation

Record the sources of all measurements. Minimally, include map name and scale, the ¤<<datum>>¤ or ¤<<coordinate reference system>>¤, the source for ¤<<elevation>>¤ data, the ¤<<accuracy>>¤ reported by the ¤<<GPS>>¤ receiver, the ¤<<UTM>>¤ Zone if using <<**UTM>> <<coordinates**>>, the ¤<<extent>>¤ and ¤<<radial>>¤ of the ¤<<location>>¤, the method used to record the ¤<<depth>>¤, etc.

[[anchor-82]]**The** Georeferencing *Process*

¤<<location,Locations>>¤ that are not fully ¤<<georeference,georeferenced>>¤ in the field may eventually have to be ¤<<georeference,georeferenced>>¤ __post-facto__ in order to be useful. One hopes in these situations that the collector of the original information followed best practices such as those described in the <<__*Elements for Describing a Location*__>>. As will be seen in <<__*3.4 Calculating Uncertainties*__>>, below, many of the greatest sources of ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ arise from missing, ambiguous, or non-specific information, which could have been avoided, but that can no longer be overcome without knowledge from someone who was there at the time the ¤<<event>>¤ occurred.

[[anchor-83]]3.1 Planning a Georeferencing Project

Before beginning a ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ project, whether for an individual researcher or a large institution, it is helpful to anticipate the kinds of challenges one might expect to encounter. It may appear to be a daunting task, but there are many ways the process can be simplified and made more practical. Having a suitable workflow (see <<__*3.1.1 Georeferencing Project Workflow*__>>) decided in advance can increase both the efficiency and the consistency of the ¤<<data quality,quality>>¤ of the resulting ¤<<georeference,georeferences>>¤. The basic determiners for a project are what you have to start with and what outputs you want when you are finished. In an ideal world, the obvious practical questions such as the cost and how long it will take would not be important, but realistically, when balanced against the benefits of making the effort, these might be the major determining factors. Following is a representative list of questions that might affect planning of a ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ project:

* About the original data:
** Where is the source data coming from (herbarium labels, ledgers, database, or a combination, etc.)

** Are the source data already digitized?

** How many distinct ¤<<locality>>¤ descriptions are there to ¤<<georeference>>¤?

** Are there terrestrial or marine *locations* to ¤<<georeference>>¤? Or both?

** Is the geographic scope local? Country-wide? Global?

* About the process:
** What is the time frame for the project?

** When in the broader workflow will ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ happen?

** How much of the established best practices do I really need to follow?

** What if we want to use our own methods?

** What procedural documentation will we need to prepare?

** Who will do what?

** What expertise is needed?

** What skills do those who will be involved possess?

** Where can training be found?

** What ¤<<location>>¤ resources (maps, ¤<<gazetteer,gazetteers>>¤, tools) are available?

* About the final product:
** What data quality target is there for the ¤<<georeference,georeferences>>¤?

** How will data validation take place?

** How will the data be maintained?

** How will the ¤<<georeference,georeferenced>>¤ data be used and by whom?

** Will the georeferences be generalized on export (for sensitive species, for example)?

** How can the ¤<<georeference,georeferences>>¤ be integrated back into the original data?

** How can we incorporate suitable ¤<<data quality>>¤ feedback mechanisms?


The question, "When in the broader workflow will ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ happen?" is of particular significance. Is it best to ¤<<georeference>>¤ each record as you enter the data into the database? Or is it better to ¤<<georeference>>¤ in a batch after the data have been entered? There are arguments for each method, and again the circumstances of your institution should dictate the best method. If the data are stored taxonomically and not geographically (as is the case in the majority of instances) it is often best to ¤<<georeference>>¤ in a batch mode by sorting the ¤<<locality>>¤ data electronically, and in this way deal with many records on one map sheet or area at a time and not be jumping back and forth between map sheets. In other cases, there may be less wear and tear on collections, you may wish to database collections as they are received and before distributing duplicates, or sending on loan, or there may be other good practical reasons to ¤<<georeference>>¤ as you go. One advantage of ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ as you go is that you may be able to do all the collections of one collector at a time, and virtually follow his/her path, thus reducing errors from not knowing which of several ¤<<locality,localities>>¤ may be correct.

This document does not cover methods of general data entry. There are many ways that this may be conducted: direct entry from the field notes, labels, or ledgers with the material brought to a data entry computer; direct entry where tablets or laptops are brought to the material; indirect entry after using scanning or photographic (still or video) equipment to capture the original information so that data entry can be done _post facto_ from images, including handwriting and OCR tools, or crowdsourcing (_e.g._, https://digivol.ala.org.au/[_DigiV_]ol (Australian Museum __n.dat., _see_ <<*4.1 DigiVol*__>>), https://www.zooniverse.org/organizations/md68135/notes-from-nature[_Notes from Nature_] (Zooniverse __n.dat., _see_ <<*4.2 Notes from Nature*__>>) to capture the data. Some of these methods are just becoming practical, but you should make an active decision on the method that best suits the needs of your project. Remember, that at the same time as digitizing is being done, and each specimen is being handled, it is a good time to consider other actions. These may not be only ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ (which we do not recommend for the sake of efficiency), but might also include such things as assigning <<Persistent Identifier (PID),*persistent identifiers>>* (**PID**s) <<__*1.9 Persistent Identifiers (PIDS)*__>> and barcoding specimens, and linking these to the database to save resources further down the line.

It is also important that the long-term maintenance of the data is considered early in the process. Things like; "How are we going to deal with corrections to the data?, How do we handle feedback on ¤<<data quality>>¤ from data aggregators, data users, etc.?, Do we have a process in place for documenting changes to the data?, and Have we budgeted sufficient resources for ongoing maintenance and ¤<<data quality>>¤ checking?

[[anchor-84]]3.1.1 Georeferencing Project Workflow

A workflow covering all the ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ activities can be a valuable instrument, not only for improving the efficiency of the whole ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ process, but also for incorporating checks and balances, and improving the **quality** of the resulting product. The type of workflow may be determined by the nature of the data, the way the original data are stored or documented, the nature of the desired end product, and even by the general preferences of those involved. In the following subsections we propose a generic workflow that covers all of the major aspects of ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ projects. Note that some of the steps presented might not apply to every project, and one must take into account priorities as discussed in <<__*3.1 Planning a Georeferencing Project*__>>. This first section, <<__*3.1.1 <<georeference,georeferencing>> Project Workflow*__*>>* outlines a recommended ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ project workflow in three phases - before, during, and after <georeference,**georeferencing**>>. Subsequent sections deal with the details of some of the steps presented in the outline.

Based on an assessment of a variety of large-scale ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ projects that had efficiency as well as ¤<<data quality>>¤ in mind (for example, see <<__*3.1.2 Project Workflow Example - MaNIS/HerpNET/ORNIS*__>>), we recommend the following generic outline for a ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ project workflow using either the <<**point-radius>> <<**georeferencing method,*method>>* or the <<**shape>> <**georeferencing method,*method>>*, or a mix of the two. This workflow can be used for projects that involve a single individual or a large collaboration, though some steps may apply more in one case than in another.

[[anchor-85]]3.1.1.1 Project Preparation Phase

* Commit to the use of a documented set of best practices such as those set forth in this document.
* Clearly define (and document) the goals of the project, including ¤<<data quality>>¤ requirements (see <<__*3.1 Planning a Georeferencing Project*__>>).
* Determine what data will be used as input for ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤.
* Select the tools to be used.
* Estimate the resources needed to complete the data preparation phase (see <<__*3.1.4 Resources needed*__>>).
* Assign someone to manage the project.
* Acquire the resources needed to start the project.

[[anchor-86]]3.1.1.2 Data Preparation Phase

* Assemble the data to be ¤<<georeference,georeferenced>>¤.
* Prepare the data for ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤:
** Make sure that original records are uniquely identified (ideally with <<Persistent Identifier (PID),**PID>>**s, see <<__*1.9 Persistent Identifiers (PIDs)*__>>).

** Extract distinct ¤<<locality,localities>>¤, generate unique identifiers (ideally <<Globally Unique Identifier (GUID),*GUIDs>>*, see <<__*1.9 Persistent Identifiers (PIDs)*__>>) for each, and reference the corresponding ¤<<locality>>¤ identifier in each original record.

** Use source-provided administrative geography fields to create and add standardized administrative geography values to the distinct ¤<<locality>>¤ records.

** Label ¤<<locality,localities>>¤ as marine, terrestrial, freshwater aquatic, or paleontologic. The same ¤<<locality>>¤ description may refer to more than one category (_e.g._, ¤<<location,locations>>¤ on coasts) unless further constraining information is used (see <<__*3.2.4 Applying Spatial Constraints*__>>). If dealing with ¤<<locality,localities>>¤ alone, you should account for all of the environmental possibilities.

** Create and uniquely identify distinct standardized ¤<<locality,localities>>¤ and reference the standardized ¤<<locality>> <<GUID>>¤ in the non-standardized ¤<<locality>>¤ records.

** Match standardized ¤<<locality,localities>>¤ against existing <<locality,**localities>> t**hat have already been ¤<<georeference,georeferenced>>¤ using satisfactory ¤<<georeferencing method,georeferencing methods>>¤ and extract the existing ¤<<georeference,georeferences>>¤ (see <<__*3.1.3 Using Previously Georeferenced Records*__>>).

* Assess the characteristics of the data to be ¤<<georeference,georeferenced>>¤ (__e.g., __how many already have ¤<<coordinates>>¤ without ¤<<georeference,georeferences>>¤? How many consist only of administrative geography? What is the geographic distribution of the ¤<<locality,localities>>¤?) with a view to determining the resources that will be needed to complete the project.
* Estimate the resources needed to complete the project using the information determined in the project preparation phase.
* Acquire the resources to complete the project.
* Train participating contributors and ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ operators (see <<__*6.3.1 Data Entry*__>> and <<__*6.6 Training*__>>).
* Establish a convention and tools to manage participation (assignments).
* Prepare data capture requirements and tools (see <<__*3.1.5 Data to Capture*__>>, <<__*3.1.7 User Interfaces*__>>, <<__*3.1.8 Using Standards and Guidelines*__>>, and <<__*5.1 Mapping to Darwin Core*__>>).
* Assign priorities to sets of standardized ¤<<locality,localities>>¤.
* Assign standardized ¤<<locality>>¤ sets to participants.

[[anchor-87]]3.1.1.3 Georeferencing Phase

* Participants ¤<<georeference>>¤ assigned ¤<<locality>>¤ sets as outlined in _*<<3.2 Georeferencing Workflow - Localities>>.*_
* Participants utilize tools such as the __*Georeferencing *__Q_*uick Reference Guide*_ (Zermoglio _et al._ 2020) and the __*Georeferencing *__C_*alculator*_ (Wieczorek & Wieczorek 2020).

[[anchor-88]]3.1.1.4 Project Follow-up Phase

* Verify ¤<<georeference,georeferences>>¤ to meet ¤<<data quality>>¤ requirements (_e.g._, map ¤<<georeference,georeferenced>>¤ records to ensure they fall in the correct hemisphere, country, etc.) (see <<__*6.3 Data Checking and Cleaning*__>>).
* Populate standardized ¤<<locality>>¤ records with data for the ¤<<georeference,georeferences>>¤.
* For original records that have not changed ¤<<locality>>¤ information since they were assembled, populate the original records from the standardized ¤<<locality>>¤ records with ¤<<georeference,georeferences>>¤.
* Repatriate the original records with standardized <<georeference,*georeferenced>> <<locality>>* data appended.
* Support the incorporation of the standardized ¤<<georeference,georeferenced>>¤ ¤<<locality>>¤ data into the source data management systems (see <<__*6.2 Accepting Feedback from Users*__>>).
* Support the sharing of the standardized ¤<<georeference,georeferenced>>¤ original data (including additional ¤<<generalization,generalizations>>¤ and withholdings) in open data venues such as GBIF (see <<__*Sharing Data*__>>).
* Establish a long-term data maintenance policy that includes the management of feedback on ¤<<data quality>>¤ and the documentation of changes (see <<__*6.2 Accepting Feedback from Users*__>>).

[[anchor-89]]3.1.2 Project Workflow Example - MaNIS/HerpNET/ORNIS

One of the major contributions of the Mammal Networked Information System (MaNIS) project (Stein & Wieczorek 2004) was the design and implementation of a set of ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ guidelines (Wieczorek 2001) and online resources for a collaborative ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ workflow (http://georeferencing.org/manis/GeorefSteps.html[_http://georeferencing.org/manis/GeorefSteps.html)_]. The same basic workflow was implemented with great success for the sister projects HerpNET (http://herpnet.org/Gazetteer/GeorefSteps.html[_http://herpnet.org/Gazetteer/GeorefSteps.html_]) and the Ornithological Information System (ORNIS) (http://www.ornisnet.org/georeferencing/workflownew[_http://www.ornisnet.org/georeferencing/workflownew_]). Between the three projects, more than 1.2 million ¤<<locality,localities>>¤ were ¤<<georeference,georeferenced>>¤ for 4.5 million vertebrate occurrence records. The basic workflow was more or less as follows:

* Establish a ¤<<georeferencing method>>¤ and select tools to be used.
* Train participants (combination of help desk, forum, documents, and in the case of HerpNET, courses).
* Establish a convention and tools to manage <<georeference, **georeferencing>> **work packages for participants.
* Aggregate occurrences and extract distinct ¤<<locality,localities>>¤ into a project ¤<<gazetteer>>¤.
* Engage participants to claim and complete (¤<<georeference>>¤) work packages.
** Participant downloads work package.

** Participant ¤<<georeference,georeferences>>¤ work package, consulting documentation and colleagues to resolve questions.

** Send finished work package to project coordinator.

* Project coordinator validates ¤<<georeference,georeferences>>¤ to meet ¤<<data quality>>¤ standards.
* Project coordinator populates communal ¤<<gazetteer>>¤ with validated ¤<<georeference,georeferences>>¤.
* When ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ is completed for the entire project, project coordinator validates that ¤<<locality,localities>>¤ for original occurrence records have not changed since they were added to the ¤<<gazetteer>>¤ and repatriates occurrence records with ¤<<georeference,georeferences>>¤ to participating data custodians.
* Everyone involved rejoices.
* Participants add ¤<<georeference>>¤ data to their data management systems as time and resources allow.
* **<**<georeference,*Georeferenced>>* occurrence records get shared via global biodiversity networks such as VertNet (Guralnick & Constable 2010) and GBIF (http://gbif.org[_http://gbif.org_]).

[[anchor-90]]3.1.3 Using Previously Georeferenced Records

It may be possible to use a look-up system that searches for similar localities that have already been ¤<<georeference,georeferenced>>¤. For example, if you have a record with the ¤<<locality>>¤ "10 km NW of Campinas", you can search for all records with ¤<<locality>>¤ "Campinas" and see if any records that mean the same thing as "10 km NW of Campinas" have been <<georeference,**georeferenced> **previously. Note that it is always worth verifying the ¤<<georeference>>¤ on a map — this can easily be done using software such as Google Maps™, Google Earth™, etc. Checking this way can reduce ¤<<error,errors>>¤ such as neglecting to add the minus (-) sign to a ¤<<coordinates,coordinate>>¤ in the western or southern hemispheres.

An extension of this method could use the benefits of a distributed data system such as the http://www.gbif.net[_Global Biodiversity Information Facility_] (GBIF) Portal. A search could be conducted to see if the ¤<<locality>>¤ had already been <<georeference,**georeferenced> **by another institution. At present, we quite often find that duplicates of occurrence records have been given significantly different ¤<<georeference,georeferences>>¤ by different institutions. Presumably this would not happen if best practices were followed, or if ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ is done by the original institution before distributing duplicates.

A preliminary study (Wieczorek pers comm.) of roughly 33.1 million occurrences for 38.7 thousand plant taxa in GBIF from 15 April 2019 (GBIF 2019) showed that the records were associated with 7.2 million distinct ¤<<location,locations>>¤, of which 25.7% (30.9% of occurrences) already had ¤<<georeference,georeferences>>¤ (_i.e._, _*decimalLatitude*_, _*decimalLongitude*_, _*geodeticDatum*_, and _*coordinateUncertaintyInMeters*_). Of those without **g**¤<<georeference,georeferences>>¤, exact matches (on geography plus ¤<<locality>>¤ fields, all turned into upper case) from other ¤<<location,locations>>¤ in GBIF could be found for 2.5% of distinct ¤<<location,locations>>¤ (11.4% of occurrences).

In the case where multiple possible ¤<<georeference,georeferences>>¤ are found using a lookup on previously existing ¤<<georeference,georeferenced>>¤ locations, the problem is knowing which of the several ¤<<georeference,georeferences>>¤, if any, to choose.

If the ¤<<georeference>>¤ is not fully documented following best practices (including being reproducible), we recommend that existing ¤<<georeference,georeferences>>¤ not be used (or used only with extreme caution). Even if the ¤<<georeference>>¤ is documented, it should be checked visually on a map to be sure that it makes sense, just as for any new ¤<<georeference>>¤.

CARE: The re-use of existing <<georeference,georeferences>> can propagate <<error,errors>>. if a mistake was made the first time. Existing <<georeference,georeferences>> should be verified just as for any newly generated <<georeference>>.

[[anchor-91]]3.1.4 Resources Needed

Each institution will have needs for different resources in order to ¤<<georeference>>¤ their ¤<<location>>¤ data. The basics, however, include:

* A database and database software (spreadsheets may be apt for data capture, but they leave a lot to be desired compared to databases for data management, for which we do not recommend the use of spreadsheets). Note that there are a lot of database management systems already established and available for use with biodiversity data. See if any of these may do the job before developing your own as it may save a lot of extra work. Many also already include ¤<<data quality>>¤ aspects that could help improve the ¤<<data quality,quality>>¤ of your own data.
* Topographic maps (electronic, paper or both), geologic maps (for paleontologic events) and/or speleological maps (for events in cave systems).
* Access to good <<gazetteer,*gazetteers>>>* and/or maps – (many are available free via the Internet, either for downloading, or via online searching).
* Internet access (as there are many resources on the Internet that will help in ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ and locating places).
* Suitable computer hardware - such as a ¤<<geographic information system,Geographic Information System>>¤.

[[anchor-92]]3.1.5 Data to Capture

The most important preparation for efficient ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ is to have a database set up for the purpose. This section will help you decide if your database will need modification or not, and to what extent.

[[anchor-93]]Some ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ projects (_e.g._, MaPSTeDI) (Murphy _et al._ 2004) used a separate working database for data entry operators so that the main data were not modified and day-to-day use of the database was not hindered. This also meant that the working database could be designed optimally for data entry, rather than trying to accommodate other database management and searching requirements. The data from the working database can be checked for quality, and then uploaded to the main database from time to time. Such a way of operating is institution dependent, and may be worth considering.

What are the fields you need in your database to best store ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ information? This may seem obvious but it is surprising how often a database is created and finalized before it is determined exactly what the database is supposed to hold. Be sure not to lump together dissimilar data into one field. Always atomize the data into separate fields with very specific definitions and rules for their content. It is also of some benefit to name the fields unambiguously, as users tend to go by the field names rather than looking at the field definitions. Thus, 'latitude_in_degrees' is a better name than *'<<latitude>>*' for a field that is supposed to contain ¤<<latitude,latitudes>>¤ in ¤<<decimal degrees>>¤, while 'verbatim_latitude' is better name for a field that is supposed to contain the ¤<<latitude>>¤ in the format given in the source. The names and definitions of fields in ¤<<Darwin Core>>¤ (Wieczorek _et al_. 2012b) were created specifically with this principle of clarity in mind. Note, however, that the ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ results might benefit from additional fields that are not described in ¤<<Darwin Core>>¤ (_e.g._, '<<**feature>>_<<radial>>**', 'radialUnits') in order to make it possible to reproduce the ¤<<georeference>>¤ and thus test it's veracity. It is often tempting to include fields for the ¤<<georeference,georeferenced>>¤ ¤<<coordinates>>¤ and ignore any additional fields; however, you (or those who follow after you) are sure to regret this minimalist approach, because it severely limits the long-term usability of the data. Not only do ¤<<location,locations>>¤ occupy a physical <<**extent>>,** but also the associated information on methods used to determine the ¤<<georeference>>¤, the <<**extent>>, <<radial>>,** and ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ associated with the ¤<<georeference>>¤ are important pieces of information for the end user, as well as for managing and improving the ¤<<data quality,quality>>¤ of your information. The fields that are needed can be divided into two categories, the first consists of the fields associated with the textual description of the ¤<<location>>¤, and the second consists of the fields associated with the spatially enabled interpretation as a ¤<<georeference>>¤ and the ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ process.

NOTE: When atomizing data on entry, always include a field or fields that record verbatim the original data so that atomization and other transformations can later be revealed and checked.

NOTE: Automatic format transformations to <<decimal degrees>> may introduce <<false precision>>. See <<1.6 Accuracy, Error, Bias, Precision, False Precision, and Uncertainty>>.

[[anchor-94]]A reference worth checking before developing your own database system is the _*Herbarium Information Standards and Protocols for Interchange of Data*_ (HISCOM 2000, Neish _et al._ 2007), which although set up for data interchange for herbaria, is applicable to most natural history collection data.

Many institutions separate ¤<<locality>>¤ descriptions into their component parts; ¤<<feature>>¤ (_i.e._, the ¤<<location>>¤ name), distance and ¤<<direction>>¤, etc., and store this information in separate fields in their databases. If this division of ¤<<locality>>¤ information is done, it is important not to replace the verbatim free-text locality field (the data as written on the label or in the field notebook), but to add additional fields. This is because any transformation of data has the potential to lose information and to introduce ¤<<error,errors>>¤, and the written format of the description may be the only original source available. The original information should __never __be overwritten or deleted.

Location-related fields to consider for ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ include all of the geography, ¤<<locality>>¤, ¤<<elevation>>¤, ¤<<depth>>¤, and ¤<<georeference>>¤ terms in the *Location* class of ¤<<Darwin Core>>¤ (see https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#location[_https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#location_] and <<__*5.1 Mapping to Darwin Core*__>>) as well as the following fields that can have an influence on the ¤<<georeference>>¤:

* As many levels of administrative subdivision as necessary (_e.g._, country, state, county, municipality, etc.), though if the geographic scope is multinational, better to name the administrative subdivisions more generically to avoid confusion (_e.g_., country, geog_admin_1, geog_admin_2, etc.).
* ¤<<feature,Feature>>¤ name, ¤<<feature type>>¤, ¤<<offset>>¤ distance, <<**offset>> <<direction**>>, ¤<<offset>>¤ units.
* <<feature,*Feature>> <<shape>>*, ¤<<feature>>¤ center, ¤<<feature>> <<radial>>¤.
* Township, range, section, subsection or similar for other ¤<<grid>>¤ systems.
* Protected area.
* Watershed.
* Map quad.
* **<<UTM>> <<easting**>>, ¤<<northing>>¤, and zone.
* For 🐠marine ¤<<location,locations>>¤ －nearest island, exclusive economic zone, etc.
* ¤<<elevation,Elevation>>¤ ¤<<accuracy>>¤, ¤<<vertical datum>>¤, and the method by which ¤<<elevation>>¤ was determined.
* ¤<<depth,Depth>>¤ ¤<<accuracy>>¤, ¤<<vertical datum>>¤, and the method by which ¤<<depth>>¤ was determined.
* ¤<<latitude,Latitude>>¤ degrees, ¤<<latitude>>¤ minutes, ¤<<latitude>>¤ seconds, ¤<<latitude>>¤ hemisphere, ¤<<longitude>>¤ degrees, ¤<<longitude>>¤ minutes, ¤<<longitude>>¤ seconds, ¤<<longitude>>¤ hemisphere.
* Environment, to distinguish terrestrial, aquatic, and marine locations.
* ¤<<event,Event>>¤ date (best to follow and enforce a standard format, such as ISO 8601 (ISO/TC 154 2019).
* Fields in the ¤<<Darwin Core>>¤ __*GeologicalContext*__ class for paleontological occurrences.

[[anchor-95]]3.1.6 Applying Data Constraints

One of the key ways of making sure that data are clean and ¤<<accuracy,accurate>>¤ is to ensure, to the extent possible, that data are put in the correct field and that only data of an appropriate type can be put into each field by design. This is done by applying constraints on the data fields – for example, only allowing values between +90 and −90 in the field for ¤<<decimal latitude>>¤. Many of the ¤<<error,errors>>¤ found when checking databases could have been easily avoided if the database had been set up correctly in the first place. The use of pick lists are essential where the field should contain only values from a restricted list of terms.

[[anchor-96]]More complex constraints may also be possible. With 🌳ecological or survey data for example, one could set ¤<<boundary>>¤ limits between the starting ¤<<locality>>¤ and ending ¤<<locality>>¤ of a ¤<<transect>>¤. For example, if your methodology always uses 1 km or shorter ¤<<transect,transects>>¤, then the database could include a ¤<<boundary>>¤ limit that flagged whenever an attempt was made to place these two points more than 1 km apart.

[[anchor-97]]For more information on constraints, see various sections under <<__*3.4.1 Uncertainty due to the Extent of the Feature*__>>.

[[anchor-98]]3.1.7 User Interfaces

Good user-friendly interfaces are essential to make ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ efficient and rapid, and to cut down on operator ¤<<error,errors>>¤. The design should take into consideration the specific details of the ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ workflow, and optimize simultaneously for both overall efficiency, and consistency of the data entry process. This will improve accuracy and cut down on ¤<<error,errors>>¤. The layout should be friendly, easy to use, and easy on the eyes. Where possible (and the software allows it) a number of different views of the data should be presented. These views can place emphasis on different aspects of the data and help data entry operator proficiency by allowing different ways of entering the data and by presenting a changing view for the operator.

[[anchor-99]]In the same way, macros and scripts can help with automated and semi-automated procedures, reducing the need for tedious (and time-consuming) repetition. For example, if the data are being entered from a number of collections by one collector, taken at the same time from the same ¤<<location>>¤, the information that is repeated from record to record should be able to be entered using just one or two keystrokes.

[[anchor-100]]If maps are being used to assist in determining ¤<<georeference,georeferences>>¤, a view that sorts the data geographically may also make the process more efficient by allowing the data operator to see all the records that may fall on one map sheet. Finally, it is also important to decide which fields the data entry operators should see when they are ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤. Fields such as date of collection, collector, specimen ID, taxonomy, and formation (for paleontologic records) are very helpful for georeferencers to see along with the more obvious ¤<<locality>>¤ data.

[[anchor-101]]3.1.8 Using Standards and Guidelines

Standard methodologies, in-house standards, and guidelines can help lead to consistency throughout the database and cut down on ¤<<error,errors>>¤. A set of standards and guidelines should be established before any ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ begins (see__* *__<<__*6.9 Documentation*__>>. They should remain flexible enough to cater for new data and changes in processes over time, though careful thought beforehand can minimize the need for methodological changes, which might lead to inconsistencies where earlier efforts are lacking compared to those produced under newer protocols. Standards and guidelines in the following areas can improve the ¤<<data quality,quality>>¤ of the data and the efficiency of data entry. They include:

* Units of measure. Use a single unit of measure in interpreted fields. For example, do not allow a mixture of feet and meters in ¤<<elevation>>¤ and ¤<<depth>>¤ fields. Irrespective of this, the original units and measurements should be retained in a verbatim field.
* Methods and formats for determining and recording ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ and ¤<<extent>>¤.

* Required fields (fields that must have meaningful, non-empty values).
* Format for recording ¤<<coordinates>>¤ (_e.g._, <<DMS,**degrees/minutes/seconds**>>, degrees/decimal minutes, or ¤<<decimal degrees>>¤ for ¤<<latitude>>¤ and ¤<<longitude>>¤).
* Original source(s) of place names and ¤<<feature,features>>¤.
* Dealing with typographical ¤<<error,errors>>¤ and other ¤<<error,errors>>¤ in the existing database.
* Number of decimal places to keep in decimal numbers.
* How to deal with "empty" values as opposed to the numerical value zero (some databases have problems with this).
* How to deal with mandatory fields that cannot be filled in immediately (_e.g._, because a reference has to be found). There may be a need for something that can be put in the field that can allow the database to be filed and closed, but that flags that the information is still required.
* What data validation is to be carried out before a record can be considered complete?

[[anchor-102]]Determining and documenting your institution’s own ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ best practice manuals, for example that suit the circumstances of that institute (including language, local software and resources, etc.) can help maintain consistency as well as assist in training and ¤<<data quality>>¤ recording. As an example, see Escobar _et al._ (2015), where an internal document for the Alexander von Humboldt Institute in Colombia has been developed and put into practice. See also <<__*6.9 Documentation*__>>.

[[anchor-103]]3.1.9 Data Entry Operators

One of the greatest sources of ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ ¤<<error>>¤ is the data entry process. It is important that this process be made user-friendly, and be set up so that many ¤<<error,errors>>¤ cannot occur (_e.g._, through the use of pick lists, field constraints, etc.). The choice and training of data entry operators (see under <<__*6.6 Training*__>>) can make a big difference to the final ¤<<data quality,quality>>¤ of the ¤<<georeference,georeferenced>>¤ data. As mentioned earlier, the provision of good guidelines and standards can help in the training process and allow for data entry operators to reinforce their training over time.

[[anchor-104]]3.2 Georeferencing Workflow - Localities

At the heart of any ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ project is the hands-on ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ of individual ¤<<locality>>¤ descriptions. The value of getting this part right can't be overstated.

Regardless of what other steps might have preceded this in a project workflow, for individual ¤<<locality,localities>>¤ we recommend the following ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ workflow — refined from Wieczorek _et al_. (2004).

* Choose the ¤<<georeferencing method>>¤ (_e.g._, ¤<<point-radius>>¤, ¤<<bounding box>>¤, ¤<<shape>>¤) to use. You may do this for all ¤<<locality,localities>>¤ or on a case by case basis (see <<__*3.3 Georeferencing Methods*__>>).
* Parse the ¤<<locality>>¤ into <locality clause,*locality clauses>>* (see __*<<3.2.1 Parsing the Locality Description*__>>).
* Identify the ¤<<feature>>¤(s) and determine the ¤<<locality type>>¤ of the most specific ¤<<locality clause>>¤ (see <<__*3.2.2 Classifying the Locality Description*__>>).
* Find the ¤<<feature>>¤(s) in a spatial data source (_e.g._, map, ¤<<gazetteer>>¤, ¤<<GIS>>¤ layer, application programming interface (API)) that can give you an idea of where the ¤<<feature>>¤ is with ¤<<coordinates>>¤, a** <<bounding box>>,** a ¤<<point-radius>>¤, or a ¤<<shape>>¤).
* Determine the ¤<<boundary,boundaries>>¤ of the ¤<<feature>>¤(s) (see <<__*3.2.3 Setting the Boundaries of the Feature*__>>) including all constraints (see <<__*3.2.4 Applying Spatial Constraints*__>>).
* Follow the protocol in the __*Georeferencing *__Q_*uick Reference Guide*_ (Zermoglio _et al_. 2020) to ¤<<georeference>>¤ the ¤<<locality>>¤ based on the ¤<<locality type>>¤ of the most specific ¤<<locality clause,clause>>¤ and the ¤<<shape>>¤ or ¤<<point-radius>>¤ of the constrained ¤<<feature>>¤ from the previous step.
* Document the sources and methods sufficiently to make the resulting ¤<<georeference>>¤ reproducible. (see <<__*1.1 Objectives*__>>).

Though the list of steps above apply to a single ¤<<locality>>¤ record, the most efficient way to implement these steps might be to do each step for all of the ¤<<locality,localities>>¤ in the set, and use the results of that step to organize the next step. For example, by identifying the ¤<<feature,features>>¤ from all of the most specific ¤<<locality clause,clauses>>¤, one could filter ¤<<locality,localities>>¤ by ¤<<feature>>¤ and with the accumulated body of information about the ¤<<feature>>¤ from all the ¤<<locality,localities>>¤ at hand, ¤<<georeference>>¤ all of the ¤<<locality,localities>>¤ containing the same ¤<<feature>>¤ together. One could also do statistics on the number of records affected by determining the ¤<<boundary,boundaries>>¤ of each ¤<<feature>>¤ and use that to prioritize which ¤<<locality,localities>>¤ get ¤<<georeference,georeferenced>>¤, if resources do not otherwise cover ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ everything. This kind of ¤<<feature>>¤ extraction could be done in the aggregate data preparation stage (see <<__*3.1.1 Georeferencing Project Workflow*__>>).

[[anchor-105]]3.2.1 Parsing the Locality Description

¤<<locality,Locality>>¤ descriptions are often given in free text and encompass a wide range of content in a vast array of formats. An important part of the ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ process is to have a consistent way to interpret the text into spatial forms that can be operated on analytically. To do this, look for the parts of the description that can be interpreted independently, called ¤<<locality clause,locality clauses>>¤, each of which can be categorized into a ¤<<locality type>>¤ (see <<__*3.2.2 Classifying the Locality Description*__>>) that uses a specific set of rules to ¤<<georeference>>¤ (Wieczorek _et al_. 2004).

[[anchor-106]]3.2.2 Classifying the Locality Description

There is a lot of variation in the way ¤<<locality clause,clauses>>¤ are written and the types of ¤<<feature,features>>¤ they reference, but there are actually very few basic ¤<<locality type,locality types>>¤, though these may have many variations depending on the ¤feature¤ ¤<<locality type,type>>¤ referenced. The __*Georeferencing *__Q_*uick Reference Guide*_ (Zermoglio _et al._ 2020) was written specifically to explain how to ¤<<georeference>>¤ all of the most common variations of ¤<<locality type,locality types>>¤ and ¤<<feature>>¤ types (Wieczorek _et al_. 2004):

* *<<coordinates>>* only (_e.g._, 27°34'23.4" N, 121°56'42.3" W)
* geographic ¤<<feature>>¤ only (_e.g._, "Bakersfield")
* distance only (_e.g._, "5 mi from Bakersfield")
* *<<heading>>* only (_e.g._, "North of Bakersfield")
* distance along a ¤<<path>>¤ (_e.g._, "13 miles east (by road) from Bakersfield")
* distance along orthogonal ¤<<direction,directions>>¤ (_e.g._, "2 miles east and 3 miles north of Bakersfield")
* distance at a ¤<<heading>>¤ (_e.g._, "10 miles east (by air) from Bakersfield")
* distances from two distinct <<path,*paths>> *(_e.g._, "1.5 mile east of Louisiana State Highway 1026 and 2 miles south of U.S. Highway 190")
* dubious (_e.g._, "presumably central Chile")
* cannot be located (_e.g._, "¤<<locality>>¤ not recorded")
* demonstrably inconsistent (_e.g._, "Sonoma County side of the Gualala River, Mendocino County")
* captive or cultivated (_e.g_., "San Diego Wild Animal Park")

A full ¤<<locality>>¤ description may contain multiple ¤<<locality clause,clauses>>¤. The goal of a ¤<<georeference>>¤ is to describe the ¤<<location>>¤ where all of the ¤<<locality clause,clauses>>¤ are true simultaneously. In ¤<<geographic information system,GIS>>¤ terms, this would be the intersection of the ¤<<shapes>>¤ for all the ¤<<locality clause,clauses>>¤ in the ¤<<locality>>¤ description. As humans, we would choose the ¤<<locality clause,clause>>¤ that is most specific and ¤<<georeference>>¤ based on that, using the information from the other ¤<<locality clause,clauses>>¤ to filter from among multiple possibilities. For example, a ¤<<locality>>¤ written as

*‘bridge over the St. Croix River, 4 km N of Somerset’*

[[anchor-107]]should be ¤<<georeference,georeferenced>>¤ with a ¤<<locality type>>¤ "geographic feature only" with subtype <<2.1.1 __*Feature - with Obvious Spatial Extent*__>> as in __*Georeferencing *__Q_*uick Reference Guide *_(Zermoglio _et al_. 2020) based on the _bridge_ as the <<**feature>>. **Of course, the second ¤<<locality clause,clause>>¤ helps us to determine which bridge (something we wouldn't be able to do without that second ¤<<locality clause,clause>>¤), but beyond that the second ¤<<locality clause,clause>>¤ contributes nothing to the ¤<<boundary,boundaries>>¤ of the ¤<<feature>>¤, nor to the ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ in the final ¤<<georeference>>¤.

[[anchor-108]]If the more specific part of the ¤<<locality>>¤ cannot be unambiguously identified, then the next less specific part of the ¤<<locality>>¤ ("4 km N of Somerset" in the example above) should be ¤<<georeference,georeferenced>>¤. In a case such as this, annotate in the ¤<<georeference>>¤ remarks with something like "unable to find the bridge, <<georeference,*georeferenced>> *'4 km N of Somerset'".

Some ¤<<locality>>¤ descriptions give information about the nature of the ¤<<offset>>¤ (‘by road’, ‘by river’, ‘by air’, ‘up the valley’, etc.). Having this information simplifies the choice of ¤<<offset>>¤-based ¤<<locality type>>¤ as <<__*2.9.3 Offset at a Heading*__>> or <<__*2.9.4 Offset along a Path*__>>.

_*Example*_:

*country*: AR *stateProvince*: Neuquén *county*: Los Lagos *locality*: 12.3 km N of (by road) Nahuel Huapi, elev: 760m

[[anchor-109]]In this example, there are four fields contributing five separate clauses. The three administrative geography terms each have one <<locality clause,clause>> of the type "_Geographic feature only_" with subtype "_Feature - with obvious spatial extent_" (see <<__*2.1.1 Feature - with Obvious Spatial Extent*__>> in __*Georeferencing *__Q_*uick Reference Guide*_ (Zermoglio _et al._ 2020)), while the <<locality>> field contains a <<locality clause,clause>> ("12.3 km N of (by road) Nahuel Huapi") of the type "_Distance along path_" (see <<__*2.2.3 Offset - Distance along a Path*__>> in __*Georeferencing *__Q_*uick Reference Guide*_) and a <<locality clause,clause>> ("elev: 760m") of the type "_Geographic feature only_" with subtype "_Feature - Path_" (see <<__*2.1.3.3 Feature - Path*__>> in __*Georeferencing *__Q_*uick Reference Guide*_). The most specific of all five <<locality clause,clauses>> is "12.3 km N of (by road) Nahuel Huapi".

It is sometimes possible to infer the nature of the ¤<<offset>>¤ ¤<<path>>¤ from additional supporting evidence in the ¤<<locality>>¤ description. For example, the ¤<<locality>>¤

____
_*‘58 km NW of Haines Junction, Kluane Lake’*_
____

[[anchor-110]]suggests a measurement by road since the final ¤<<coordinates>>¤ by that ¤<<path>>¤ are nearer to the lake than going 58 km NW in a straight line. At other times, you may have to consult detailed supplementary sources, such as field notes, collectors’ itineraries (see <<__*3.2.4.3 Using Collector Itineraries*__>>), diaries, or sequential collections made on the same day, to determine this information.

If any of the ¤<<locality clause,clauses>>¤ in the ¤<<locality>>¤ description is classified as one of the three ¤<<locality>>¤ types, ‘_dubious_’, ‘_cannot be located_’, or ‘_demonstrably inaccurate_’, then the ¤<<locality>>¤ should not be ¤<<georeference,georeferenced>>¤. Instead, an annotation should be made to the ¤<<locality>>¤ record giving the reason why it is not being ¤<<georeference,georeferenced>>¤. See also <<__*2.4 Difficult Localities*__>> in Zermoglio et al. (2020).

[[anchor-111]]3.2.3 Setting the Boundaries of the Feature

Regardless of the method to be used (*shape*, **bounding box, **or *point-radius*), the *georeferencing* *protocols* for nearly every *locality type* begin with the identification of the *features* of reference in the *locality* description and the determination of the *geographic boundaries* of their *extents*. This is usually the most critical and time-consuming part of the protocols. It is best to use a visual reference to determine *boundaries.* If a **feature** name search on a visual source does not reveal the **feature** of interest, it is a good idea to use** coordinates** from a **gazetteer** to find the *feature* on a map, and then use the map to find the *boundaries:*

* *Point-radius method*: store the *corrected center* of the constrained *boundaries* from the previous step as decimal **latitude** and decimal **longitude** and store the *geographic radial* as a distance in the units given in the most specific *locality clause*. If there are no distance units in that *clause*, use meters (see <<__*3.3.2 Point-radius Method*__>>.
* *Bounding Box* method: store the furthest north, south, east, and west coordinates on the constrained boundaries of the feature (see <<__*3.3.3 Bounding Box Method*__>>.
* *Shape method*: store the resulting constrained *boundaries* as a *shape *(see <<__*3.3.4 Shape Method*__>>

Use information from other clauses, such as administrative geography, information from other *location* fields such as *elevation*, and environmental information (_e.g._, terrestrial, freshwater aquatic, marine, taxon-specific) to constrain the *extent* as appropriate (see <<__*3.2.4 Applying Spatial Constraints*__>> and <<__*3.1.6 Applying Data Constraints*__>>).

[[anchor-112]]3.2.4 Applying Spatial Constraints

There are many ways that a ¤<<location>>¤ can be constrained beyond what the geography and ¤<<locality>>¤ descriptions alone suggest. Doing so relies on applying additional ¤<<location>>¤ information, such as ¤<<elevation>>¤ or ¤<<depth>>¤, lithostratigraphic information for fossils, or information outside the ¤<<location>>¤ information, such as environmental constraints for a particular species. There are important implications about workflow and effort that need to be considered when applying additional constraints. For example, if taxon constraints are going to be applied, the ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ can not be done strictly on ¤<<location>>¤ information, which means it has to be done on occurrence records, or on an index combining ¤<<location>>¤ and taxon. This would be much slower than ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ based on ¤<<location>>¤ alone. A good compromise would be to ¤<<georeference>>¤ in multiple stages, with the first stage based on ¤<<location>>¤ information, and a subsequent stage including the rest of the occurrence information, and perhaps a final stage of review by collectors to be able to set _*dwc:georeferencingVerificationStatus*_ to "verified by collector" - the best status a ¤<<georeference>>¤ can possibly have.

[[anchor-113]]3.2.4.1 Taxon Constraints

It is common to encounter ¤<<locality>>¤ descriptions for which the ¤<<boundary,boundaries>>¤ and ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ could be reduced if the taxon and its environmental or geographic constraints are known.

One case in which a taxon constraint might be applied is where a ¤<<locality>>¤ description would be ¤<<georeference,georeferenced>>¤ in a distinct manner if it was known to be terrestrial, aquatic, or marine. Here even the lifestage of a taxon could be taken into account.

🐠OBIS (the Ocean Biogeographic Information System) uses the _*World Register of Marine Species*_ (WoRMS 2019) to determine if a species can be classified as either marine or terrestrial. Note, however, that there are many species listed in the WoRMS database that occur on coastal shores or in estuaries (__i.e., __species that could be regarded as both marine and terrestrial at some stage during their life cycle), so caution needs to be taken when using this method in ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤.

At the generic level there are similar biome-matching services available through The _*Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera*_ _*(IRMNG)*_ (Rees 2019), and the associated _*LifeWatch*_ taxon matching services (http://www.lifewatch.be/data-services/[_http://www.lifewatch.be/data-services/_]).

Another case where taxon might be taken into account is where a distribution range or environmental domain suggests a restriction in the ¤<<boundary,boundaries>>¤ of a ¤<<location>>¤. However, this kind of constraint on a ¤<<georeference>>¤ is not recommended, because an organism whose location falls outside of an established range map may indicate a genuine outlier, or a taxon misidentification. Given that, such information can help distinguish between two possible ¤<<location,locations>>¤ of the same ¤<<feature>>¤ name where one possible ¤<<location>>¤ fits within the environmental domain for the taxon, and the other outside the range. This auxiliary information is also particularly useful after ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤, to reveal records of possible range extensions, exotic invasions, or cryptic taxa.

[[anchor-114]]3.2.4.2 Using Date Constraints

The date is an important characteristic of an ¤<<event>>¤ and must be recorded. Towns, roads, counties, and even countries can change names and ¤<<boundary,boundaries>>¤ over time, and can even cease to exist as extant ¤<<feature,features>>¤. Rivers and coastlines can change position, billabongs and ox-bow lakes can come and go, and areas of once pristine environment may become farmland or urban areas.

[[anchor-115]]**Example:** "Collecting localities along the Alaska Highway are frequently given in terms of milepost markers; however, the Alaska Highway is approximately 40 km shorter than it was in 1942 and road improvements continue to re-route and shorten it every year. Accurate location of a milepost, therefore, would require cross-referencing to the collecting date. To further complicate matters, Alaska uses historical mileposts (calibrated to 1942 distance), the Yukon uses historical mileposts converted to kilometers, and British Columbia uses actual mileage (expressed in kilometers)".(From Wheeler _et al._ 2001)

To the extent possible, the aim is to have a ¤<<georeference>>¤ and its ¤<<uncertainty,uncertainties>>¤ based on the conditions at the time an ¤<<event>>¤ occurred at a ¤<<locality>>¤. There are two major implications associated with this. One is that current maps and ¤<<gazetteer,gazetteers>>¤ may not reflect the conditions at the time of the ¤<<event>>¤, and the other is that old maps and ¤<<gazetteer,gazetteers>>¤ may not represent well the conditions of later ¤<<event,events>>¤.

We recommend that this sort of constraint be used in a followup workflow step to deal with ¤<<locality,localities>>¤ at the ¤<<event>>¤ level rather than try to construct a ¤<<gazetteer>>¤ that includes collecting dates.

[[anchor-116]]3.2.4.3 Using Collector Itineraries

Collector’s itineraries and expedition tracks can be a useful adjunct in discovering locations that are otherwise difficult to find, especially where there may be more than one possible ¤<<location>>¤ based on a ¤<<feature>>¤ name. This may be done through using field notebooks, published reports and maps, searching for the ¤<<locality,localities>>¤ of specimens with adjacent collecting numbers, etc. With historic collecting events (_i.e._, before the days of modern transport), you may also be able to restrict the area to look in by limiting the distance a collector may have been able to travel within one day. Note that the collector name and date are essential pieces of information in tracking itineraries, and therefore can not be done on ¤<<locality,localities>>¤ alone. We thus recommend that this sort of constraint be used in a followup workflow step to deal with unresolved ¤<<locality,localities>>¤ rather than try to construct a ¤<<gazetteer>>¤ that includes collecting dates, collector names, and collector numbers.

[[anchor-117]]3.2.4.4 Using Ship Logs

🐠Digitized ships logs contain a wealth of data (Dempsey 2014) and are valuable data resources. A freely downloadable database of surface marine observational records from ships, buoys, and other platform types is available as the _*International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set*_ (https://icoads.noaa.gov/products.html[_https://icoads.noaa.gov/products.html_]) (NOAA 2018). Be aware that the ¤<<accuracy>>¤ of records obtained from this dataset vary, depending on the original source, and are not always documented.

[[anchor-118]]3.2.4.5 Using Geological Context

Maps or ¤<<geographic information system,GIS>>¤ layers of geological contexts, such as formations, can be used to narrow the ¤<<location>>¤ in the case of a paleontological specimen that includes such information in the shared content of the record. For example, if a fossil is taken from the surface in the Fox Hills formation (which is Cretaceous in age), that can distinguish the ¤<<location>>¤ from nearby different formations on the surface, like a habitat could do in an ecological context.

[[anchor-119]]3.3 Georeferencing Methods

The distinction between ¤<<georeferencing method,georeferencing methods>>¤ is in the basic approach taken to capture spatially enabled ¤<<location>>¤ data. Within each ¤<<georeferencing method,method>>¤ there should be protocols for how to produce ¤<<georeference,georeferences>>¤ based on the input ¤<<locality>>¤ description and supporting information. The goal of any ¤<<georeferencing method>>¤ and its specific, documented protocols should be to create a spatial representation of the entire ¤<<location>>¤, including all ¤<<uncertainty,uncertainties>>¤ involved, with sufficient accompanying information and documentation to make the ¤<<georeference>>¤ reproducible.

[[anchor-120]]__*3.3.1 Point Method*__

Based on the aspirations for ¤<<georeferencing method,georeferencing methods>>¤ described in the previous paragraph, the point method, consisting of only ¤<<coordinates>>¤, or ¤<<coordinates>>¤ in a ¤<<coordinate reference system>>¤, is insufficient to be useful except to center a point on a map (and even that potentially incorrectly without the ¤<<coordinate reference system>>¤). The point method does not give any indication of scale, though the mistake is often made to try to represent scale and/or ¤<<uncertainty,uncertainties>>¤ in the ¤<<precision>>¤ of the ¤<<coordinates>>¤. For these reasons, the point method is *NOT* recommended as the end product of a ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ workflow.

[[anchor-121]]3.3.2 Point-radius Method

The result of the ¤<<point-radius>>¤ ¤<<georeferencing method,method>>¤ (Wieczorek _et al._ 2004) is a ¤<<geographic coordinate>>¤ (the "¤<<corrected center>>¤"), its ¤<<geodetic datum>>¤, and a ¤<<maximum uncertainty distance>>¤ as a ¤<<radial,radius>>¤. The length of the ¤<<radial,radius>>¤ must be large enough so that a circle centered on the ¤<<corrected center>>¤ and based on that ¤<<radial,radius>>¤ encompasses all of the ¤<<uncertainty,uncertainties>>¤ in the interpretation of the ¤<<location>>¤. The ¤<<point-radius>>¤ is a very simple representation of the ¤<<location>>¤ that contains all of the places that the ¤<<locality>>¤ description might refer to, but may also circumscribe areas that do not match the ¤<<locality>>¤ description. That's OK. The ¤<<point-radius>>¤ circle can also be intersected with other spatially enabled information to constrain the effective area within the circle, such as ¤<<elevation>>¤, to derive a ¤<<shape>>¤ representation of the ¤<<locality>>¤. For example, calculate the intersection of a ¤<<point-radius>>¤ circle with the ¤<<shape>>¤ of the matching ¤<<elevation>>¤ contours in a ¤<<geographic information system>>¤ to get a ¤<<shape>>¤ that better matches the described ¤<<locality>>¤. Similarly, one could calculate the intersection of an exposed geological formation with a ¤<<point-radius>>¤ ¤<<georeference>>¤ to refine the latter into a ¤<<shape>>¤. The detailed recommended protocols for ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ using the ¤<<point-radius>>¤ <georeferencing method,*method>>* are given in the __*Georeferencing *__Q_*uick Reference Guide *_(Zermoglio __*et al.*__ 2020).

[[anchor-122]]3.3.3 Bounding Box Method

The result of the ¤<<bounding box>>¤ ¤<<georeferencing method,method>>¤ (Wieczorek _et al._ 2004) is a set of two ¤<<coordinates>>¤, one for each of two corners diagonally opposed on the ¤<<bounding box>>¤ along with their ¤<<coordinate reference system>>¤. The corners define the minimum and maximum values of the ¤<<coordinates>>¤, within which the whole of the ¤<<location>>¤ and its ¤<<uncertainty,uncertainties>>¤ is contained. Like the ¤<<point-radius>>¤ <georeferencing method,*method>>*, the ¤<<bounding box>>¤ <georeferencing method,*method>>* results in a very simple representation of the ¤<<location>>¤ that contains all of the places that the ¤<<locality>>¤ description might refer to, but may also contain areas that do not match the ¤<<locality>>¤ description.

Unlike the ¤<<point-radius>>¤ <georeferencing method,*method>>*, this method has no scalar ¤<<maximum uncertainty distance>>¤ to be able to easily understand or filter on the size of the enclosed region, though one can be calculated using half the distance between the two corners as given by Vincenty's formulae (Vincenty 1975, 1976). Thus, a ¤<<bounding box>>¤ ¤<<georeference>>¤ can be turned into a ¤<<point-radius>>¤ ¤<<georeference>>¤ by using the distance just described as the ¤<<geographic radial>>¤, and from that finding the ¤<<corrected center>>¤, which will not be equal to the ¤<<geographic center>>¤ of the ¤<<bounding box>>¤, except where the ¤<<bounding box>>¤ spans equal distances north and south of the equator or is based on a metric ¤<<grid>>¤.

A <<**point-radius>> <<georeference>> **can be turned into a ¤<<bounding box>>¤ *<<georeference>>* by using the ¤<<geographic radial>>¤ from the ¤<<corrected center>>¤ of the ¤<<point-radius>>¤ to determine the ¤<<coordinates>>¤ of the east-west and north-south extremes of the ¤<<bounding box>>¤.

NOTE: Though transformations can be made back and forth between <<point-radius>> and <<bounding box>> representations of a <<location>>, it is not recommended, because the transformed <<georeference>> will necessarily be bigger than the original, and therefore contain more area that does not pertain to the actual <<location>>. Better to <<georeference>> directly using the <<georeferencing method,method>> of choice.

Like the ¤<<point-radius>>¤ circle, the ¤<<bounding box>>¤ can also be intersected with other spatially enabled information to constrain the effective area within.

[[anchor-123]]3.3.4 Shape Method

The ¤<<shape>>¤ ¤<<georeferencing method,method>>¤* *(also called the polygon method by some (Yost 2015)) of determining ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ is a conceptually simple method that delineates a ¤<<locality>>¤ using ¤<<geometry,geometries>>¤ with one or more polygons, buffered points, or buffered polylines. A combination of these ¤<<shape,shapes>>¤ can represent a town, park, river, junction, or any other ¤<<feature>>¤ or combination of ¤<<feature,features>>¤ found on a map. While simple to describe, the task of generating these ¤<<shape,shapes>>¤ must account for all the ¤<<uncertainty,uncertainties>>¤, and that can be difficult. Except for the simplest ¤<<locality type,locality types>>¤, creating ¤<<shape,shapes>>¤ is impractical without the aid of digital maps, ¤<<geographic information system,GIS>>¤ software (for buffering, clipping, etc.), and expertise, all of which can be relatively expensive. Also, except for a ¤<<bounding box>>¤, which is an extremely simple example, storing a ¤<<shape>>¤ in a database can be considerably more complicated than storing a single pair of ¤<<coordinates>>¤ with a scalar ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ distance as in the ¤<<point-radius>>¤ <<georeferencing method, *method>>*. ¤<<Darwin Core>>¤ (Wieczorek _et al_. 2012b) offers the field _*dwc:footprintWKT*_, in which a ¤<<geometry>>¤ can be stored in the Well-Known Text format (ISO 2016) accompanied by the ¤<<coordinate reference system>>¤ in the field _*dwc:footprintSRS*_. Particular challenges to making this method practical for ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ natural history collections data include assembling freely accessible digital cartographic resources and developing tools for automation of the ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ process (Yost _n.dat_.). This is because, not only does the ¤<<geometry>>¤ of the ¤<<feature>>¤ usually need to be created (unless it is an administrative ¤<<boundary>>¤ or other ¤<<shape>>¤ available in a spatial data layer), but also all the points in the ¤<<feature>>¤ ¤<<geometry>>¤ have to be used in combination with the ¤<<uncertainty,uncertainties>>¤ to arrive at a final ¤<<shape>>¤ that includes the ¤<<location>>¤ with its ¤<<uncertainty,uncertainties>>¤ and nothing more. Note that GEOLocate (Rios 2019) does produce an "error polygon" (Biedron and Famoso 2016) in addition to a ¤<<point-radius>>¤, but how this is done is not documented in detail (http://www.geo-locate.org/point_radii.html[_http://www.geo-locate.org/point_radii.html_]).

Of all the methods discussed in this document, the ¤<<shape>>¤ <georeferencing method, *method>>* has the potential to generate the most specific digital spatial descriptions of ¤<<locality,localities>>¤, leaving out areas that are not viable as part of the ¤<<location>>¤. A ¤<<point-radius>>¤ can be easily derived from a final ¤<<shape>>¤ by using the ¤<<corrected center>>¤ for the ¤<<coordinates>>¤ and the ¤<<geographic radial>>¤ of the ¤<<georeference>>¤ (not just the ¤<<feature>>¤) for the ¤<<maximum uncertainty distance>>¤. See <<Figure 15>> for one example of where a ¤<<point-radius>>¤ may be refined by using the ¤<<shape>>¤ <<georeferencing method, *method>>*. See also <<__*2.3.3 Polygons*__>>.

[[anchor-124]]3.3.5 Probabilistic Method

Other shape-based <<georeferencing method, *methods>>* have been proposed that use probabilistic approaches (Guo _et al._ 2008, Liu _et al._ 2009). Since these <<georeferencing method, *methods>>* are even more difficult than the ¤shape¤ <<georeferencing method, *method>>*, and there are currently no tools available to take advantage of these <<georeferencing method, *methods>>*, we do not discuss them further in this document.

[[anchor-125]]3.4 Calculating Uncertainties

Regardless of the <<georeferencing method, *method>>*, ¤<<uncertainty,uncertainties>>¤ in ¤<<georeference,georeferenced>>¤ data are essential to document, so that the data’s fitness for use and thus their overall ¤<<data quality>>¤ can be understood. There are sources of ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ in each ¤<<locality>>¤ interpretation as well as in the data sources used to ¤<<georeference>>¤, and any physical measurement that might need to be made (such as on maps, digital or physical). Each of the sources of ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ have to be taken into account to capture the overall ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ in a resulting ¤<<georeference>>¤.

Whenever subjectivity is involved, it is preferable to overestimate each contribution to ¤<<uncertainty>>¤. The following seven sources of ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ are the most commonly encountered. These are explained below and can be accounted for by using the Georeferencing Chttp://manisnet.org/gci2.html[_*alculator*_] (Wieczorek & Wieczorek 2020).

* ¤<<uncertainty,Uncertainty>>¤ due to the ¤<<extent>>¤ of the ¤<<feature>>¤ in the ¤<<locality>>¤ description.
* ¤<<uncertainty,Uncertainty>>¤ in ¤<<coordinates,coordinate>>¤ source.
* ¤<<uncertainty,Uncertainty>>¤ in map measurements.
* ¤<<uncertainty,Uncertainty>>¤ related to ¤<<coordinate precision>>¤.
* ¤<<uncertainty,Uncertainty>>¤ from unknown ¤<<coordinate reference system>>¤ or ¤<<datum>>¤.
* ¤<<uncertainty,Uncertainty>>¤ related to ¤<<heading>>¤.
* ¤<<uncertainty,Uncertainty>>¤ related to ¤<<offset>> <<precision>>¤.

[[anchor-126]]3.4.1 Uncertainty Due to the Extent of the Feature

[[anchor-127]]The first step in determining the ¤<<coordinates>>¤ for a ¤<<locality>>¤ description is to identify the most specific ¤<<feature>>¤ within the ¤<<locality>>¤ description. ¤<<coordinates,Coordinates>>¤ may be retrieved from ¤<<gazetteer,gazetteers>>¤, geographic name databases, maps, or from other ¤<<locality>>¤ descriptions that have <**coordinates>>** or ¤<<shape,shapes>>¤. We use the term ‘¤<<feature>>¤’ to refer to not only traditional named places, but also to places that may not have proper names, such as road junctions, stream confluences, highway mile pegs, and cells in ¤<<grid>>¤ systems (_e.g._, Quarter Degree Square Cells, see <<__*2.3.4.2 Quarter Degree Squares*__>>). The source and ¤<<precision>>¤ of the <**coordinates>>** should be recorded so that the validity of the ¤<<georeference,georeferenced>>¤ ¤<<locality>>¤ can be checked. The original ¤<<coordinate system>>¤ and the ¤<<geodetic datum>>¤ should also be recorded. This information helps to determine sources and the ¤<<maximum uncertainty distance>>¤, especially with respect to the original ¤<<coordinate precision>>¤.

How do we take into account the ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ due to the ¤<<shape>>¤ of the ¤<<feature>>¤? The method that results in the least ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ is to find the ¤<<smallest enclosing circle>>¤ (Matoušek _et al_. 1996) that contains all of the points on the ¤<<geographic boundary>>¤ of the ¤<<feature>>¤. If the center of the circle does not fall on or within the ¤<<boundary>>¤ of the ¤<<feature>>¤, choose the point nearest to the center that is on the ¤<<boundary>>¤. This is known as the ¤<<corrected center>>¤. The distance from the ¤<<corrected center>>¤ to the farthest point on the ¤<<geographic boundary>>¤ of the ¤<<feature>>¤ is called the ¤<<geographic radial>>¤. The ¤<<geographic radial>>¤ is the ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ due to the ¤<<extent>>¤ of the ¤<<feature>>¤ (see <<Figure 4>>).

Every ¤<<feature>>¤ occupies a finite space, or ‘¤<<extent>>¤’. The ¤<<extent,extents>>¤ of <,feature,*features>>* are an important source of ¤<<uncertainty>>¤. Points of reference for ¤<<feature,features>>¤ may change over time – post offices and courthouses are relocated, towns change in size, the courses of rivers change, etc. Moreover, there is no guarantee that the person who recorded the ¤<<locality>>¤ information paid attention to any specific convention when reporting a ¤<<locality>>¤ as an ¤<<offset>>¤ from a ¤<<feature>>¤. For example,

__*‘4 km E of Bariloche, Argentina’*__

may have been measured from the post office, the civic plaza, or from the bus station on the eastern side of the heavily populated part of town, or anywhere else in Bariloche, which is actually quite large. When calculating an ¤<<offset>>¤, we generally have no way of knowing where the person who recorded the ¤<<locality>>¤ started to measure the distance. The determination of the ¤<<boundary,boundaries>>¤ of a ¤<<feature>>¤ are discussed in <<__*3.2.3 Setting the Boundary of the Feature*__>>.

It is also worth noting that the ¤<<extent>>¤ of a ¤<<feature>>¤ may have changed over time, so the date of the recording may also be important when calculating an ¤<<extent>>¤ and thus the ¤<<geographic radial>>¤. In many cases (especially for populated places), the current ¤<<extent>>¤ of a ¤<<feature>>¤ will be greater than its historical ¤<<extent>>¤ and the ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ may be somewhat overestimated if current maps are used.

If the ¤<<locality>>¤ described is an irregular shape (_e.g._, a winding road or river), there are two ways of calculating the "center" ¤<<coordinates>>¤ and determining the ¤<<radial>>¤. The first is to measure along the vector (line) and determine the midpoint as the ¤<<location>>¤ of the ¤<<feature>>¤. This is not always easy, so the second method is to determine the ¤<<geographic center>>¤ (_i.e._, the midpoint of the extremes of ¤<<latitude>>¤ and ¤<<longitude>>¤) of the ¤<<feature>>¤. This method describes a point where the ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ due to the ¤<<extent>>¤ of the ¤<<feature>>¤ is minimized (what we are calling the ¤<<corrected center>>¤). The ¤<<radial>>¤ is then determined as the distance from the determined position to the furthest point at the extremes of the vector. If the ¤<<geographic center>>¤ of the ¤<<shape>>¤ is used and it does not lie within the ¤<<locality>>¤ described (_e.g._, the ¤<<geographic center>>¤ of a segment of a river does not actually lie on the river), then the point nearest the ¤<<geographic center>>¤ that lies within the shape (¤<<corrected center>>¤) is the preferred reference for the ¤<<feature>>¤ and represents the point from which the ¤<<geographic radial>>¤ should be calculated (see <<Figure 4>>).

[[anchor-128]]When documenting the ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ process, it is recommended that the ¤<<feature>>¤, its *extent*, *radial*, and the source of the information (including its date) all be recorded. For details on georeferencing, see <<__*2.1 Geographic Feature Only*__>> in __*Georeferencing *__Q_*uick Reference Guide*_ (Zermoglio _et al._ 2020).

¤<<geographic coordinates,Geographic coordinates>>¤ can be expressed in a number of different <<coordinate format,*coordinate formats>>.* ¤<<decimal degrees,Decimal degrees>>¤ provide the most convenient ¤<<coordinates>>¤ to use for ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ for no more profound reason than a ¤<<locality>>¤ can be described with only four attributes - ¤<<decimal latitude>>¤,* <<decimal longitude>>*, ¤<<datum>>¤, and ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ (Wieczorek 2001).

[[anchor-129]]3.4.2 Uncertainty in Coordinate Source

There are many ways of finding ¤<<coordinates>>¤ for a ¤<<location>>¤, including using a ¤<<gazetteer>>¤, a ¤<<geographic information system,GPS>>¤, aerial photogrammetry, digital maps, or paper maps of many different types, and scales.

[[anchor-130]]3.4.2.1 Uncertainty in Paper Map Measurements

One of the most common methods of finding ¤<<coordinates>>¤ for a ¤<<location>>¤ is to estimate the ¤<<location>>¤ from a paper map. Using paper maps can be problematic and subject to varying degrees of inaccuracy. Unfortunately, the ¤<<accuracy>>¤ of many maps, particularly old ones, is undocumented. ((accuracy,**Accuracy>> **standards generally explain the physical ¤<<error>>¤ tolerance on a printed map, so that the net ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ is dependent on the map scale (see <<Table 1>>).

Map reading requires a certain level of skill in order to determine ¤<<coordinates>>¤ ¤<<accuracy,accurately>>¤, and different types of maps require different skills. Challenges arise due to the ¤<<coordinate system>>¤ of the map (¤<<latitude>>¤ and ¤<<longitude>>¤, ¤<<UTM>>¤, etc.), the scale of the paper map, the line widths used to draw the ¤<<feature,features>>¤ on the maps, the frequency of ¤<<grid>>¤ lines, etc.

The ¤<<accuracy>>¤ of a map depends on the ¤<<accuracy>>¤ of the original data used to compile the map, how ¤<<accuracy,accurately>>¤ these source data have been transferred onto the map, and the resolution at which the map is printed or displayed. For example, USGS maps of 1:24,000 and 1:100,000 are different products. The ¤<<accuracy>>¤ is explicitly dependent on scale but is due to the different methods of preparation. When using a map, the user must take into account the limitations encountered by the map maker such as acuity of vision, lithographic processes, plotting methodologies, and symbolization of ¤<<feature,features>>¤ (_e.g._, line widths) (Hardy & Field 2012).

With paper topographic maps, drawing constraints may restrict the ¤<<accuracy>>¤ with which lines are placed on the map. A 0.5 mm wide line depicting a road on a 1:250,000 map represents 125 meters on the ground. To depict a railway running beside the road, a separation of 1-2 mm (250-500 meters) is needed, and then the line for the railway (another 0.5 mm or 125 meters) makes a total of 500-750 m as a minimum representation. If one uses such ¤<<feature,features>>¤ to determine an occurrence ¤<<locality>>¤, for example, then minimum ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ would be in the order of 1 km. If thicker lines were used, then appropriate adjustments would need to be made (Chapman _et al._ 2005).

The National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy (NSSDA) (FGDC 1998) established a standard methodology for calculating the horizontal and vertical ¤<<accuracy>>¤ of printed maps, which state that 95% of all points must fall within a specified tolerance (1/30" for map scales larger than 1:20,000, and 1/50" for map scales smaller than or equal to 1:20,000).

<<Table 1>> shows the inherent ¤<<accuracy>>¤ of a number of maps at different scales. The <<Table 1,table>> gives uncertainties for a line 0.5 mm wide at a number of different map scales. A value of 1 mm of ¤<<error>>¤ can be used on maps for which the standards are not published. This corresponds to about three times the detectable graphical ¤<<error>>¤ and should serve well as an ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ estimate for most maps.

The <<Table 1,table>> uses data from several sources. The TOPO250K Map series is the finest resolution mapping that covers the whole of the Australian continent. It is based on 1:250,000 topographic data, for which Geoscience Australia (2007, Section 2) defines the ¤<<accuracy>>¤ as "_not more than 10% of well-defined ¤<<feature,features>>¤ are in error by more than 140_ _meters_ (for 1:250,000 scale maps)_; more than 56_ _meters _(for 1:100,000 maps)". The USGS Map Horizontal Uncertainty is calculated from US Bureau of Budget (1947) (reported in United States National Map Accuracy Standards (USGS 1999) https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/1999/0171/report.pdf[_https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/1999/0171/report.pdf_]) which states that "_As applied to the USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle topographic map, the horizontal <<accuracy>> standard requires that the positions of 90 percent of all points tested must be <<accuracy,accurate>> within 1/50th of an inch (0.05_ _centimeters) on the map. At 1:24,000 scale, 1/50th of an inch is 40_ _feet (12.2_ _meters)._" These values need to be taken into account when determining the ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ of your ¤<<georeference>>¤.

If you are using phenomena that do not have distinct ¤<<boundary,boundaries>>¤ in nature to determine a ¤<<locality>>¤ (such as soils, vegetation, geology, timberlines, etc.) then err vastly on the side of conservatism when determining an ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ value as such <boundary,**boundaries>> **are seldom ¤<<accuracy,accurate>>¤, often determined at a scale of 1:1 million or worse and would have a minimum ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ of between 1 and 5 km. Also be aware that coastlines vary greatly at different scales (see Chapman _et al._ 2005) and rivers are often straightened on smaller scale maps, and can thus include ¤<<uncertainty,uncertainties>>¤ far greater than are generally recorded on maps whose ¤<<accuracy,accuracies>>¤ are determined from "well-defined" points such as buildings, road intersections, etc. In addition, coastlines and river ¤<<path,paths>>¤ can change greatly over time (World Ocean Review 2010) and thus the date of the map needs to be taken into account when determining ¤<<uncertainty>>¤.

In addition to the inherent inaccuracies of printed maps, one must consider inaccuracies that can arise from using maps to measure distances. These potential inaccuracies are a direct consequence of the projection of the map and one's ability to distinguish between two adjacent points, which may be affected by your measuring device and even your eyesight. A straight line distance measurement only works on a map in an equal distance projection, where distance follows the same scale regardless of the orientation. Unless the conditions for measuring are particularly poor, it is reasonable to use 1 mm as a value for measurement ¤<<error>>¤ on physical maps. Depending on the scale of the map, this translates into a distance on the ground.

[[anchor-131]]3.4.2.2 Uncertainty in Digital Map Measurements

Digital versions of traditional paper maps that have been scanned or digitized by hand using a digitizing tablet to trace lines, have an extra layer of ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ (Dempsey 2017). Depending on how the map was digitized, the ¤<<error>>¤ may be small or large when compared to the scale of the original map. In parts of the world where digitized maps are not readily available, they can be scanned and rectified using satellite data (Raes _et al._ 2009). Scanned maps often (and should always) include information on the ¤<<accuracy>>¤ added by the digitizing process (see ASPRS 1990). Be careful when using digital maps, and record any information on the scanning ¤<<accuracy>>¤ if that information is available. Always err on the cautious side when recording the ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ of your ¤<<georeference>>¤ when using maps of this type (ASPRS 2014).

NOTE: A digital map is never more <<accuracy,accurate>> than the original from which it was derived, nor is it more <<accuracy,accurate>> when you zoom in on it. The <<accuracy>> is strictly a function of the scale and digitizing <<error,errors>> of the original map, plus the additional <<error>> added by the digitization process.

CARE: Care must be used when using a digital map that records the scale in the form of text (e.g., 1:100,000) rather than by using a scale bar, as the resolution of the computer screen, and the level of zooming will change the apparent scale of the map being viewed. (It does not change the scale at which the map was prepared). This also applies to maps printed from a digital map. When preparing digital maps, always include scale as a scale bar and do not just record scale in textual form (e.g., 1:20,000).

Measurement ¤<<error>>¤ is not unique to physical maps, it also enters into measurements on digital media. In general, the resolution of the media affects one's ability to distinguish between two points, and this in turn can be affected by the extent to which the media is zoomed. Note that zooming does not improve the ¤<<accuracy>>¤ of the original source from which the media was derived. That ¤<<accuracy>>¤ remains an independent factor, as described in the earlier paragraphs in this section. Naturally, the greater the zoom, the easier it is to pinpoint a ¤<<location>>¤. This effect of zoom on digital media also has an effect on one's ability to measure along a ¤<<path>>¤ in that medium. The greater the zoom, the easier it is to follow the ¤<<path>>¤ faithfully and thus determine a distance along that ¤<<path>>¤ with the least ¤<<error>>¤. The greater the curviness of the ¤<<path>>¤, the greater the potential effect on ¤<<accuracy>>¤. Note also, that the scale of the map may reduce the curviness of a ¤<<path>>¤ (road, river, etc.) and that small scale maps tend to smooth out the ¤<<path,paths>>¤ of rivers, roads, coastlines, and other curved linear ¤<<feature,features>>¤ (Chapman _et al_. 2005).

[[anchor-132]]3.4.2.3 Using OpenStreetMap™, Google Maps™, and Google Earth™

With the ever increasing availability of high-quality satellite imagery and ¤<<shape,shapes>>¤ for geographic ¤<<feature,features>>¤, online digital map resources are increasingly being used to find ¤<<feature,features>>¤ and their ¤<<boundary,boundaries>>¤, and to ¤<<georeference>>¤. Some sites have tools that are particularly suited for drawing and measuring on maps. In Google Maps™, for example, the measuring tool can be initiated by clicking at your starting point or origin, then using right-click to select _*Measure distance*_ from a pop-up menu__*.*__ You can then click on your end point and a line segment with distance indicators will join the two chosen ¤<<location,locations>>¤. You can click repeatedly to trace a ¤<<path>>¤, such as along a road or river. You can also close the shape to make a polygon by clicking on the starting point again. Once you have your line or polygon, you can modify the node positions (for example after zooming in further), and add intermediate nodes. It can also be used to determine distance from a point, such as "5 km N of [*feature*]". By closing the polygon, you can get an area as well as total distance. Determine ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ as you would for any other map, but be aware of the effects of the level at which you may be zoomed in. One's capacity to point ¤<<accuracy,accurately>>¤ is higher at higher zoom levels. One can test the effect empirically by trying repeatedly to put a marker on the center of a ¤<<feature>>¤ that can be seen at low zoom levels, then checking how far off they are on average at higher zoom levels.

The positional ¤<<error>>¤ on Google Maps™ and Google Earth™ is poorly documented and varies both geographical and with imagery resolution. We recommend the conservative combination of root mean square <<error>> from Google Earth™ and Landsat imagery of 89.7m estimate derived by Potere (2008) for Google Earth™ or Google Map™ readings in or before 2008. After that, we recommend the 8m (95% confidence interval) estimated by Paredes-Hernández _et al_. (2013). Limited data based on the ¤<<accuracy>>¤ of street junctions on OpenStreetMap™ (Helbich _et al._ 2012) suggests that this source has ¤<<accuracy>>¤ of the same order of magnitude as the Google products.

¤<<elevation,Elevation>>¤ coverage from Google Maps™ is inconsistent, it can be obtained by reading the contour lines in mountainous areas in the Terrain view, but it does not show ¤<<elevation>>¤ by default and not in cities or areas where there are no natural ¤<<elevation>>¤ gradients. In Google Earth™ one can access ¤<<elevation>>¤ information everywhere and it is visible with the ¤<<latitude>>¤ and ¤<<longitude>>¤ in the lower right of the view screen. ¤<<elevation,Elevation>>¤ in Google Earth™ is based on the ¤<<mean sea level>>¤ model of the EGM96 ¤<<geoid>>¤. Note that this can vary by up to 200 meters from the ¤<<WGS84>>¤ reference ¤<<ellipsoid>>¤ in some areas (see <<Figure 8>>). As noted under <<__*2.7.7 Google Earth™*__>>, we recommend using the values extracted from the work of Wang _et al_. (2017) as estimates of ¤<<elevation,elevational>> <<uncertainty>>¤ when the source is the Google Earth™ terrain model.

[[anchor-133]]3.4.2.4 Uncertainties in Marine Maps

Harbour charts are generally produced at a scale of 1:10,000, and coastal charts at 1:50,000 to 1:150,000, and often in the Mercator projection. A page on Navigation - finding ¤<<location>>¤ on nautical maps can be seen at http://www.coastalnavigation.com/samples/sec_1/1_pages/1_3.htm. A majority of new maps (post-2019) are only being produced digitally (NOAA, pers. comm. 25 Jan 2020), with paper maps being produced from the digital product.

For most marine or nautical charts, the ¤<<accuracy>>¤ and reliability of the information used to compile the chart is recorded as Zones of Confidence (ZOC) (Prince 2020http://www.hydro.gov.au/prodserv/important-info/accuracy_and_reliability_of_charts.pdf[)]. ZOC categories warn mariners which parts of the chart are based on good or poor information and which areas should be navigated with caution. The ZOC system consists of five categories for assessed ¤<<data quality>>¤, with a sixth category for data which has not been assessed (<<Table 2>>).

Positional ¤<<accuracy>>¤ refers to the horizontal ¤<<accuracy>>¤ of a ¤<<depth>>¤ or ¤<<feature>>¤. ¤<<depth,Depth>> <<accuracy>>¤ refers to the vertical ¤<<accuracy>>¤ of individual recorded ¤<<depth,depths>>¤, of which those shown on the chart are a subset designed to best represent the sea floor as it is known or estimated.

[[anchor-134]]3.4.2.5 Uncertainty due to GPS

[[anchor-135]]The ¤<<uncertainty,uncertainties>>¤ inherent in various <GNSS,*Global Navigation Satellite Systems>>* and ¤<<GPS>>¤/¤<<GNSS>>¤ devices are discussed in detail in Section <<__*2.6.2 GPS Accuracy*__>>. The most common way of getting ¤<<coordinates>>¤ in the field is from a ¤<<GNSS>>¤-enabled device, which includes most smartphones. Most user interfaces on hand-held ¤<<GPS>>¤/¤<<GNSS>>¤ devices and applications on smartphones show a "GPS Accuracy". The figure shown as "Accuracy" isn't true ¤<<accuracy>>¤. It is the EPE (Estimated Position Error) (Herries 2012). In other words, it is the probability that the location the ¤<<GPS>>¤ is displaying is within the "¤<<accuracy>>¤" distance from the true ¤<<location>>¤. Keep in mind that a ¤<<GPS>>¤ receiver doesn't actually know its true ¤<<location>>¤. It calculates a ¤<<location>>¤, based on the data received from the satellites. However, if the instrument has a ¤<<bias>>¤, it still may give a low reported "Accuracy" (_i.e._, the repeated measurements may be close together) but they may be some distance from the true ¤<<location>>¤ (see <<Figure 1>>). While most ¤<<GPS>>¤ manufacturers don’t tell you how they calculate "¤<<accuracy>>¤", you can consider it a figure that says "most of the time, the displayed ¤<<location>>¤ ¤<<coordinates>>¤ are within X distance of the ¤<<GPS>>¤ receiver" (where X is the "¤<<accuracy>>¤" figure).

[[anchor-136]]The "Accuracy" value is affected by the current satellite configuration (the number of satellites that are visible and their positions in the sky (satellite ephemeris)), and a vast host of environmental variables between the device and the satellites that affect the signal trajectories and signal-to-noise ratios. Without access to a ¤<<SBAS>>¤ (see <<__*2.6.4 Satellite Based Augmentation System*__>>), this value can be used only as an indicator of relative ¤<<accuracy>>¤, but it is statistically always less than the real value. This is easy to demonstrate with sufficient repeated measurements of ¤<<coordinates>>¤ and purported ¤<<accuracy>>¤ at the same well-known ¤<<location>>¤ over time. The mean ¤<<accuracy>>¤ value will be less than the mean distance shift between the mean ¤<<coordinates,coordinate>>¤ given by all readings (a statistical proxy for the true ¤<<coordinates>>¤) and the individual ¤<<coordinates,coordinate>>¤ readings. Herries (2012) recommends doubling the Accuracy (EPE) reported by the ¤<<GPS>>¤ Receiver (including smartphones) to get a more realistic representation of true ¤<<accuracy>>¤.

[[anchor-137]]In summary, the EPE (‘accuracy’ given on a ¤<<GPS>>¤) is not a maximum ¤<<uncertainty>>¤, but an equal (50%) chance that your position lies with a ¤<<radial,radius>>¤ of that value. To get a 95% confidence level that your measurement is within a circle of a fixed ¤<<radial,radius>>¤, you have to multiply the EPE value by two as an absolute minimum. For details on <<georeference,georeferencing>> ¤<<GPS>> <<coordinates>>¤ see <<__*1.6.15 GPS Accuracy*__>>, and <<__*2.3.1 Coordinates - Geographic Coordinates*__>> in the __*Georeferencing *__Q_*uick Reference Guide*_ (Zermoglio _et al._ 2020).

[[anchor-138]]3.4.2.6 Uncertainty due to using previously georeferenced localities

[[anchor-139]]Using previously ¤<<georeference,georeferenced>>¤ <<locality,*localities>> *- whether from your own database, or from an external source can introduce ¤<<uncertainty,uncertainties>>¤. If the source is previously ¤<<georeference,georeferenced>>¤ ¤<<locality,localities>>¤ from your own database, then it is important that you retain all the metadata associated with that previously ¤<<georeference,georeferenced>> <<locality>>¤ with all subsequent records. Similarly, if using an external source, try and record a DOI reference or similar if possible, so that any subsequent changes can be traced.

[[anchor-140]]NOTE: When using previously <<georeference,georeferenced>> <<locality,localities>> as a source, if an <<error>> was made with the original <<georeference,georeferencing>>, then it will be perpetuated through all subsequent <<georeference,georeferences>>.

[[anchor-141]]3.4.3 Uncertainty Related to Coordinate Precision

¤<<geographic coordinates,Geographic coordinates>>¤ should always be recorded using as many digits as possible; the ¤<<precision>>¤ of the ¤<<coordinates>>¤ should be captured separately from the ¤<<coordinates>>¤ themselves, preferably as a distance, which conserves its meaning regardless of ¤<<location>>¤ and ¤<<coordinates,coordinate>>¤ transformations. Recording ¤<<coordinates>>¤ with insufficient ¤<<precision>>¤ can result in unnecessary ¤<<uncertainty,uncertainties>>¤. The magnitude of the ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ is a function of not only the ¤<<precision>>¤ with which the data are recorded, but also of the ¤<<datum>>¤ and the ¤<<coordinates>>¤ themselves. This is a direct result of the fact that a degree does not correspond to the same distance everywhere on the surface of the earth.

<<Table 3>> shows examples of the contributions to ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ for different levels of ¤<<precision>>¤ in ¤<<coordinates>>¤ using the ¤<<WGS84>>¤ reference ¤<<ellipsoid>>¤. Calculations are based on the same degree of ¤<<precision,imprecision>>¤ in both ¤<<coordinates>>¤ and are given for several different ¤<<latitude,latitudes>>¤. Approximate calculations can be made based on this <<Table 3,table>>, however, more ¤<<accuracy,accurate>>¤ calculations can be obtained using the _*Georeferencing Calculator*_ (Wieczorek & Wieczorek 2020) - see further discussion below.

From <<Table 3>>, it can be seen that an observation recorded in degrees, minutes, and seconds (¤<<DMS>>¤) has a minimum ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ of between 32 and 44 meters.

CARE: False <<precision>> can arise when transformations from <<DMS,degrees minutes seconds>> to <<decimal degrees>> are stored in a database (see Glossary for expanded discussion).

CARE: Never use <<precision>> in a database as a surrogate for the <<coordinates,coordinate>> <<uncertainty>>; instead, record the <<uncertainty>> explicitly, preferably as a distance.

NOTE: Details of calculations used to determine <<uncertainty,uncertainties>> in <<coordinate precision,coordinate precisions>> can be found in *__http://manisnet.org/docs/GeorefGuide.html#imprecision_in_coordinates[_*Wieczorek (2001)*_]_* and Wieczorek et al. (2004).

_*Example*_:

*Lat:* 10.27° *Long:* −123.6° *Datum:* WGS84

[[anchor-142]]In this example, the lat/long <<precision>> is 0.01 degrees. Thus, <<latitude>> <<error>> = 1.1061 km, <<longitude>> <<error>> = 1.0955 km, and the <<uncertainty>> resulting from the combination of the two is 1.5568 km.

_*Example*_:

*Lat:* 10.00000° *Long:* −123.50000° *Datum:* WGS84

[[anchor-143]]In this example, the lat/long <<precision>> is 0.5 degrees because neither <<coordinates,coordinate>> demonstrates more specificity than that. Thus, <<latitude>> <<error>> = 55.6 km, <<longitude>> <<error>> = 54.75 km, and the <<uncertainty>> resulting from the combination of the two is 77.87 km.

[[anchor-144]]3.4.4 Uncertainty from Unknown Datum

It is important to record the ¤<<datum>>¤ used for the ¤<<coordinates,coordinate>>¤ source (¤<<GPS>>¤, map sheet, ¤<<gazetteer>>¤) if it is known, or to record the fact that it is not known. ¤<<coordinates,Coordinates>>¤ without a ¤<<coordinate reference system>>¤ are ambiguous. ¤<<geographic coordinates,Geographic coordinates>>¤ with a ¤<<datum>>¤ constitute a ¤<<coordinate reference system>>¤ (see <<__*2.5 Coordinate Reference System*__>>), but seldom do natural history collections have complete ¤<<coordinate reference system>>¤ information. Even with a ¤<<GPS>>¤ being used to record ¤<<coordinates>>¤ in the field, the ¤<<geodetic datum>>¤ is typically ignored.

The ambiguity from a missing ¤<<datum>>¤ varies geographically and adds greatly to the ¤<<error>>¤ inherent in the ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤. Differences between ¤<<datum,datums>>¤ may cause an ¤<<error>>¤ in true ¤<<location>>¤ from a few centimeters up to kilometers (Wieczorek 2019). Note that the difference between ¤<<datum,datums>>¤ is not a simple function that can be calculated on the fly. The values have to be pre-calculated comparing all ¤<<datum,datums>>¤ to a reference ¤<<datum>>¤ of choice (_e.g._, ¤<<WGS84>>¤) at every point of interest over the earth's surface and stored in a way that can be looked up by ¤<<geographic coordinates>>¤. The __*Georeferencing *__C_*alculator*_ (Wieczorek & Wieczorek 2020) is capable of doing such a lookup (see <<__*3.4.9 Using the Georeferencing Calculator*__>>). In the absence of looking up the actual value by ¤<<coordinates>>¤, the worst case scenario of 5359 m (Wieczorek 2019) can be used.

[[anchor-145]]3.4.5 Uncertainty Related to Heading

The calculation of ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ from the ¤<<precision>>¤ in which a ¤<<direction>>¤ is recorded depends on the distance from the starting reference ¤<<feature>>¤. The ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ will increase with increasing distance from the source. For simple determinations of angular ¤<<precision>>¤ due to ¤<<direction>>¤ – see <<Table 4>>.

NOTE: The <<uncertainty>> due to directional <<precision,imprecision>> increases with distance, so it can only be calculated from the combination of distance and direction (see below).

*Table 4.* Calculating ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ using the ¤<<precision>>¤ of the recorded direction (derived from Wieczorek _et al._ 2004).

*Figure 11.* Diagram showing directional ¤<<precision>>¤ for the interpretation of NE between ENE and NNE. ¤<<uncertainty,Uncertainty>>¤ (*x*, and *y*) grows with distance from the ¤<<feature>>¤.

Using the example

**‘**__*10 km NE of Lambert Centre*__*’*

and if we ignore distance ¤<<precision,imprecision>>¤, ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ due to the ¤<<direction>>¤ ¤<<precision,imprecision>>¤ (<<Figure 11>>) is encompassed by an arc centered 10 km (*d*) from the center of Lambert Centre (at *x,y*) at a heading of 45 degrees (*θ*), extending 22.5 degrees in either direction from that point. At this scale the distance (*e*) from the center of the arc to the furthest extent of the arc (at *x',y'*) at a heading of 22.5 degrees (*θ'*) from the center of Lambert Centre can be approximated by the Pythagorean Theorem,

____
**e=sqrt( (x'-x)**^*2*^** + (y'-y)**^*2 *^*) *
____

and the ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ in the above example would be 3.90 km.

This shows just one simple example. For details and formulae for calculating more complicated ¤<<uncertainty,uncertainties>>¤, see http://manisnet.org/docs/GeorefGuide.html#combinations_of_uncertainties_distances[_Wieczorek (2001)_] and Wieczorek _et al._ (2004). Because of the complicated nature of these calculations, it is best to use the __*Georeferencing *__C_*alculator*_ (Wieczorek & Wieczorek 2020) - see <<__*3.4.9 Using the Georeferencing Calculator*__>>.

[[anchor-146]]3.4.6 Uncertainty Related to Offset Precision

¤<<precision,Precision>>¤ can be difficult to gauge from a ¤<<locality>>¤ description as it is seldom, if ever, explicitly recorded. Further, a database record may not reflect, or may reflect incorrectly, the ¤<<precision>>¤ inherent in the original measurements, especially if the ¤<<locality>>¤ description in the database has undergone normalization, reformatting, or secondary interpretation of the original ¤<<locality>>¤ description.

There are a number of ways of calculating ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ from distances. In this document, we have taken a conservative approach, which assumes that many records have undergone a certain amount of interpretation or transformation when being entered into the database. Thus, a record of "10¼ mi" may be entered into the database as 10.25 mi. The ¤<<precision>>¤ implied in the value 10.25 is thus a ¤<<false precision>>¤ and the real ¤<<precision>>¤ should not be assumed to be between 10.24 and 10.26 or between 10.2 and 10.3. The method of Wieczorek__ et al. __(2004), adapted here, bases the estimate of uncertainty on the fractional part of the distance, calculated by dividing 1 by the fractional denominator. The ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ would just be half of the ¤<<precision>>¤. For example, 10.5 mi N of Bakersfield could reasonably be expected to mean 10½ mi with a ¤<<precision>>¤ of half a mile between 10.25 and 10.75 mi, or 10.5 with an **uncertainty** of 0.25 mi.

For distance measurements that are positive integer powers of 10, the ¤<<precision>>¤ should be ten to the next lower power This calculation differs from Wieczorek 2004, which recommended that the ¤<<precision>>¤ should be based on ten to the same power. Upon reconsideration, that seems excessive (see <<Table 5>>). This same reasoning can be used for ¤<<precision>>¤ in verbatim ¤<<elevations>>¤ and ¤<<depths>>¤.

*Table 5.* Calculating ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ using the ¤<<precision>>¤ from a distance recording. Adapted from Wieczorek _et al. _(2004) and Frazier _et al._ (2004).

[cols=",,",]
|==========================================================================================================
|*Example* |*Uncertainty *(adapted from Wieczorek __et al. __2004) |*Uncertainty *(Frazier __et al. __2004)
|10.1 km |0.05 km |0.1 km
|10.25 mi |0.125 mi |0.01 mi
|10.5 km |0.25 km |0.1 km
|10.6 mi |0.05 mi | 0.1 mi

|2000 m |50 m |300 m
|==========================================================================================================

¤<<precision,Precision>>¤ can also be masked or lost when measurements are converted, such as from feet to meters, or from miles to kilometers.

CARE: Be careful that the value you are using for <<precision>> when calculating the <<uncertainty>> is a true <<precision>> and not a <<false precision>>. For example, converting a collector’s recording of 16 miles (with a <<precision>> of 1 mile) to 25.6 km (with a <<precision>> of 0.1 km) leads to an unwarranted level of <<precision>> that is more than 16 times higher than the original.

<<Figure 12>> shows an example of two orthogonal distances measured from a ¤<<feature>>¤, each with the ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ due to distance ¤<<precision>>¤. If we ignore all sources of ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ except those arising from distance ¤<<precision>>¤, the ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ is a ¤<<bounding box>>¤ centered on the point 8 km E and 6 km N of the ¤<<corrected center>>¤ of the ¤<<feature>>¤. Each of the distance measurements demonstrates a ¤<<precision>>¤ of 1 km. Thus, each side of the box is a total of 1 km in length (0.5 km ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ in each cardinal direction from the center). Since we are characterizing the ¤<<precision>>¤ as a single distance measurement (1 km), we need the circle that circumscribes the above-mentioned ¤<<bounding box>>¤ to get the ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ due to the combined distance ¤<<precision,precisions>>¤. The radius of this circle is half the length of the distance ¤<<precision>> <<bounding box>>¤, which is equal to one half the square root of two times the distance ¤<<precision>>¤. So, for the above example the ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ associated with only the distance ¤<<precision>>¤ is one half the square root of two, or 0.707 km.

The net ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ from distance ¤<<precision>>¤ is represented by a circle (d) that circumscribes the ¤<<bounding box>>¤ and which has a ¤<<radial>>¤ of 0.707 km. By convention the ¤<<heading,headings>>¤ for localities with offsets in orthogonal directions are exactly in the specified directions and contribute no ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ due to ¤<<direction>>¤ ¤<<precision>>¤.

[[anchor-147]]3.4.7 Combined Uncertainties

[[anchor-148]]When combining ¤<<uncertainty,uncertainties>>¤ from different sources, it is not as simple as taking the average or adding them together. ¤<<uncertainty,Uncertainties>>¤ inherent in the ¤<<location>>¤ of the ¤<<feature>>¤, in its ¤<<extent>>¤, in the direction of the ¤<<offset>>¤, and the distance of the ¤<<offset>>¤, are just four sources that need to be combined to get an overall ¤<<uncertainty>>¤. A detailed discussion of the calculations involved can be found in http://manisnet.org/docs/GeorefGuide.html#combinations_of_uncertainties_directions[_Wieczorek (2001)_] and Wieczorek _et al._ (2004). For a practical way of calculating ¤<<uncertainty,uncertainties>>¤ in ¤<<locality>>¤ descriptions, we recommend the _*Georeferencing Calculator*_ (Wieczorek & Wieczorek 2020). To understand how each source of ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ contributes to the net overall ¤<<uncertainty>>¤, see <<__*Understanding uncertainty contributions*__>> in the __*Georeferencing *__C_*alculator Manual*_ (Bloom _et al,_ 2020).

[[anchor-149]]3.4.8 Using the Georeferencing Quick Reference Guide

The __*Georeferencing *__Q_*uick Reference Guide*_ (Zermoglio__ et al.__ 2020) is a practical guide for ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ giving step-by-step instructions on how to ¤<<georeference>>¤ a wide variety of <<locality type,*locality types>> *(see <<__*3.2 Georeferencing Workflow - Localities*__>>) following the best practices in this document and with specific reference on what to enter into the __*Georeferencing *__C_*alculator*_ (Wieczorek & Wieczorek 2020).

[[anchor-150]]3.4.9 Using the Georeferencing Calculator

The __*Georeferencing *__C_*alculator*_ (Wieczorek & Wieczorek 2020) (<<Figure 13>>), is a tool to aid in ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ descriptive ¤<<locality,localities>>¤ such as those found in museum-based natural history collections. It was originally designed for the Mammal Networked Information System (MaNIS) Project and has since been adopted by many other ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ initiatives. The current version and its __*Georeferencing *__C_*alculator Manual*_ (Bloom _et al._ 2020) have been extensively upgraded to include new features and to bring it in line with this document.

The application makes calculations adapted from the methods originally described in the _*Georeferencing Guidelines*_ (Wieczorek 2001) and later formalized in a peer-reviewed publication (Wieczorek 2004). We recommend its use generally by all natural history institutions to calculate ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ in ¤<<location>>¤ data without the need for a detailed understanding of the complicated underlying algorithms. The more institutions that use this one method, the more consistent will be the ¤<<data quality,quality>>¤ of data across and between institutions, making it easier for users to evaluate the ¤<<data quality,quality>>¤ of the data. We recommend reading both of the above-mentioned publications and the __*Georeferencing *__C_*alculator Manual*_ (Bloom _et al._ 2020) for an understanding of the calculations involved and an understanding of how the __*Calculator *__works.

The __*Calculator *__can work online (at http://georeferencing.org/georefcalculator/gc.html[_http://georeferencing.org/georefcalculator/gc.html_]) or locally in a browser (latest release available on GitHub at https://github.com/VertNet/georefcalculator/releases[_https://github.com/VertNet/georefcalculator/releases_]).

[[anchor-152]]3.5 Difficult Localities

Some localities are difficult to ¤<<georeference>>¤. For some the recommendation is to not even try. These are generally ¤<<locality,localities>>¤ without sufficient information, with conflicting or ambiguous information, or where the information is explicitly in question. Some ¤<<locality,localities>>¤ reference a ¤<<feature>>¤ that can't be found with easily available resources. For these it may be just a matter of applying enough effort, but if the project is on a budget that can not support lengthy investigations into difficult ¤<<locality,localites>>¤, they may need to be left for another time. Difficult ¤<<locality,localites>>¤ are not uncommon. Don't despair. Some interesting ones have been documented by the MaNIS project at http://georeferencing.org/manis/ClassicLocalities.html[_http://georeferencing.org/manis/ClassicLocalities.html_].

Some 🐠marine ¤<<locality,localites>>¤ can also provide difficulties - for example "Off Mar del Plata". The trouble is, one doesn’t know how far "off" Mar del Plata the ¤<<event>>¤ took place. In terrestrial ¤<<locality,localites>>¤ one can generally make a decision that it is between the ¤<<feature>>¤ and the next ¤<<feature>>¤, but in the marine environment, that may not be as easy. Does it mean "within sight of", 5km, 12km, the EEZ boundary, the continental shelf…? One does not reliably know the end point so it makes it difficult (if not impossible) to ¤<<georeference>>¤ ¤<<accuracy,accurately>>¤. One good resource for finding marine ¤<<locality,localites>>¤, ¤<<boundary,boundaries>>¤, etc. is the website http://www.marineregions.org[_marineregions.org_] (VLIZ 2019).

[[anchor-153]]3.6 Determining Spatial Fit

¤<<spatial fit,Spatial fit>>¤ is a ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ concept designed to measure how well a given geometric representation matches the original spatial representation. This is useful when spatial transformations change the way a ¤<<locality>>¤ is represented, either to mask its detail, or to match an agreed upon schema for data sharing (such as fitting ¤<<location,locations>>¤ to a ¤<<grid>>¤ cell).

A ¤<<spatial fit>>¤ with a value of "1" is an exact match or 100% overlap. If the ¤<<geometry>>¤ given does not completely encompass the original spatial representation, then the ¤<<spatial fit>>¤ is zero (_i.e._, some of the original is outside the transformed version, which we interpret as not being a fit). If the transformed shape does completely encompass the original spatial representation, then the value of the ¤<<spatial fit>>¤ is the ratio of the area of the transformed ¤<<geometry>>¤ to the area of the original spatial representation. Special case: If the original spatial representation is a point and the ¤<<geometry>>¤ presented is not a point, then the ¤<<spatial fit>>¤ is undefined. The range of values of ¤<<spatial fit>>¤ is 0, 1, greater than 1, or undefined (see <<Figure 14>> and <<Table 6,Tables 6>>, <<Table 7,7>>, <<Table 8,8>>, and <<Table 9,9>>).

An example of the applicability of the ¤<<spatial fit>>¤ is where a point representing a terrestrial collection lies close to the coast, and the calculated ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ ¤<<radial,radius>>¤ encompasses some 🐠marine area. In this case the ¤<<spatial fit>>¤ would be greater than 1 as it represents an area greater than the real ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ (<<Figure 15>>). ¤<<spatial fit,Spatial fit>>¤ is also a valuable measure for describing the degree of ¤<<generalization>>¤ of a sensitive species, for example see <<__*5.2 Generalizing Georeferences for Sensitive Taxa and Locations*__>> and Chapman (2020).

[[anchor-158]]**Collaborative Georeferencing**

The characteristics that make a ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ project collaborative are the aggregation of occurrence records from multiple participating groups (_e.g._, datasets, collections, institutions), the extraction of distinct ¤<<locality,localities>>¤ as the actual target of ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤, the standardization of the geography of the aggregated records to aid record grouping and assignment by geography.

Collaborative ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤, if done properly, can have definitive advantages over ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ alone. MaNIS (Wieczorek 2001) and https://www.anbg.gov.au/chah/avh/avh.html[_Australia's Virtual Herbarium_] (ANBG 2018) found that collaborative ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ resulted in great efficiency gains, but that including validation checks afterwards by reviewing the records using collector and date, or looking at the records taxonomically to check for outliers, and other such ¤<<data quality>>¤ flags, is important. Advantages and disadvantages of collaborative ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤, adapted from Wieczorek & Beaman (2002) and Stein & Wieczorek (2004) include:

*Advantages*

* Reduces overall cost of supplies (_e.g_., maps) – no duplication.
* Expands the pool of resources – geographic expertise and reference materials.
* Takes advantage of regional expertise, knowledge, language skills and resources.
* Increases <<georeference,**georeferencin**g>> rates – economy of scale.
* Promotes standardization of methods.
* Increases skills in a community.
* Increases exposure and awareness inside and outside of a community － strengthens community relationships.

*Disadvantages:*

* Vulnerable to procrastination, delays, uneven levels of training, expertise and commitment.
* Can distance the ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ process from useful primary resources (_e.g._, specimen labels and field notes).
* Introduces time sensitivity to the ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ process (¤<<locality>>¤ information for the underlying occurrence records might be subject to changes during the ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ process that would render a different result).
* Data ¤<<repatriate,repatriation>>¤ into the originating collection can be a difficult and time-consuming process.
* Requires project-level management.
* Requires a formalized validation process.

One of the greatest impediments to effective collaborative ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤, is the absence of tools to easily ¤<<repatriate>>¤ the ¤<<georeference,georeferenced>>¤ information back to the data sources (Barkwell and Murrell 2012, Grant __et al. __2018). A number of projects are working on this, especially GEOLocate (see, <<__*4.3 GEOLocate*__>>) in conjunction with the Symbiota platform (Gries _et al_. 2014). It is hoped that this document will provide consistency of methodology and documentation and lead to more collaborative ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤.

Some organizations, such as https://digivol.ala.org.au/[_DigiVol_] (Australian Museum _n.dat._) and https://www.zooniverse.org/organizations/md68135/notes-from-nature[_Notes from Nature_] (Zooniverse _n.dat._) use crowdsourcing to ¤<<georeference>>¤, whereas projects like https://coge.geo-locate.org/[_CoGeo_] (part of GEOLocate, GEOLocate 2018), are more constrained in their participants.

[[anchor-159]]4.1 DigiVol

The http://www.ala.org.au/[_Atlas of Living Australia_], in collaboration with the http://australianmuseum.net.au/[_Australian Museum_], developed http://volunteer.ala.org.au/[_DigiVol_] (Australian Museum _n.dat._) to harness the power of online volunteers (also known as crowdsourcing) to digitise biodiversity data that is locked up in biodiversity collections, field notebooks and survey sheets. Although originally developed in Australia, DigiVol has many projects and expeditions from all over the globe. Not all DigiVol projects (called expeditions) include a ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ component, but some of them do, and there is no reason that there won’t be more in the future. The Australian Museum has developed a guide for a mapping tool to use with DigiVol (Edey _n.dat._). The mapping tool, however, has a number of features that we would not recommend. Default positions are given for the "center" of a number of Australian States without an appropriate associated ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ value. The ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ of the ¤<<georeference>>¤ is added by a pulldown menu that gives three options, viz; 1km, 5km and 10km. Our recommendation would be to make ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ continuous - possibly by selection on the map, or calculated using the body of information in this document, the protocols of the __*Georeferencing *__Q_*uick Reference Guide*_ (Zermoglio _et al._ 2020), and the algorithms of the __*Georeferencing *__C_*alculator*_ (Wieczorek & Wieczorek 2020).

[[anchor-160]]4.2 Notes from Nature

The https://www.notesfromnature.org/[_Notes from Nature_] project (Zooniverse _n.dat._) gives people the opportunity to make scientifically important contributions toward the goal of conserving and making available knowledge about natural and cultural heritage. "_Every transcription that is completed brings us closer to filling gaps in our knowledge of global biodiversity and natural heritage_". It is very similar to the DigiVOL project (Australian Museum__ n.dat__.) mentioned above. Currently, there are no ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ projects (expeditions) in Notes from Nature, but there are plans to develop this in the future.

[[anchor-161]]4.3 GEOLocate

The GEOLocate suite of tools includes a web-based collaborative client - https://coge.geo-locate.org/[_CoGeo_] (Rios 2019), the goal of which is to provide a mechanism whereby groups of users can form communities to collaboratively ¤<<georeference>>¤ and verify a shared dataset (GEOLocate 2018). This allows for the upload of a CSV file and having parts of the dataset allocated to a user. GEOLocate can also be accessed through third party applications via its API.

Using the tools in GEOLocate, a ¤<<georeference>>¤ may be determined along with an ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ (Biedron and Famoso 2016). An ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ polygon (see also ¤<<shape>>¤ and <<__*3.3.4 Shape Method*__>>) can also be drawn in addition to the ¤<<point-radius>>¤ circle. Note that GEOLocate may return more than one candidate ¤<<location>>¤ for a given ¤<<locality>>¤ string and users are advised to always verify and adjust, as needed, to obtain the final accepted result (including <<**uncertainty>> <<radial,radii>> **and polygons). The data can be exported through KML for plotting onto Google Earth™. The system allows for review of records and we recommend that this be done for all records where possible.

[[anchor-162]]4.4 Other Collaborative Georeferencing Projects

Other projects, including the terrestrial vertebrate precursor projects to VertNet (Stein and Wieczorek 2004, Guralnick and Constable 2010), have, in the past, divided up and distributed the records for ¤<<locality,localities>>¤ from a given geographic region to an institution with expertise in and/or resources about that region to ¤<<georeference>>¤ (see <<link:#_4m7ma8cnsp7x[_*3.1.2 Project Workflow Example - MaNIS/HerpNET/ORNIS*_]>>). The major advantages of this approach are that the quantity and ¤<<data quality,quality>>¤ of the raw materials used for ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ are probably higher, and the efficiency and ¤<<data quality,quality>>¤ of the results are also likely higher than if attempted without taking advantage of these resources. However, as mentioned earlier, ¤<<repatriate,repatriation>>¤ of the ¤<<georeference,georeferenced>>¤ records is an issue that needs solving for this to work most efficiently.

[[anchor-163]]**Sharing Data**

[[anchor-164]]<<georeference*,Georeferencing>>* is only the first step toward making biological (specimen and observation) data available to the world. However, it is an important first step, as it is one of the two most key methods for identifying what and where a specimen is, viz. its scientific name and its location (Chapman 2005a). Two main standards have been developed for sharing biological data, ¤<<Darwin Core>>¤ (Wieczorek _et al_. 2012b) and Access to Biological Collections Data (ABCD, https://www.tdwg.org/standards/abcd/[_https://www.tdwg.org/standards/abcd/_]), both ratified by Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG, http://www.tdwg.org[_http://www.tdwg.org_]). We do not treat the ABCD standard separately in this document, as term mappings between ¤<<Darwin Core>>¤ and ABCD are well defined for location data (see https://github.com/tdwg/dwc/blob/master/vocabulary/term_versions.csv[_https://github.com/tdwg/dwc/blob/master/vocabulary/term_versions.csv_]. One of the principles of ¤<<Darwin Core>>¤ is to try to provide content for every field possible.

[[anchor-166]]5.2 Generalizing Georeferences for Sensitive Taxa and Locations

As recommended elsewhere in this document, ¤<<georeference,georeferences>>¤ should be recorded and stored at the best possible resolution and ¤<<precision>>¤. If, however, the ¤<<location>>¤ of a taxon is regarded as sensitive for some reason following the guidelines as set out in Chapman (2020), and Chapman & Grafton (2008), and it is agreed that the detailed ¤<<location>>¤ information should not be shared, we recommend, that the data only be ¤<<generalize,generalized>>¤ at the time of sharing or publishing of the data.

We recommend that if data are to be ¤<<generalize,generalized>>¤ that it be done by reducing the number of decimal places (for example when using ¤<<decimal degrees>>¤) at which the data are published (Chapman & Grafton 2008, Chapman 2020). Good practice dictates that whatever you do to <<**generaliz>>e **the data, it be documented so that users of the data know what reliance can be placed on them. As far as the ¤<<generalize,generalization>>¤ of ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ data is concerned it is important to record that the data have been ¤<<generalization,generalized>>¤ using a ‘_decimal geographic grid_’, and record both:

* ¤<<precision,Precision>>¤ of the data provided (_e.g._, 0.1 degree; 0.001 degree, etc.)
* ¤<<precision,Precision>>¤ of the data stored or held (_e.g._, 0.0001 degree, 0.1 minute, 1 second, etc.)

We recommend that when recording the degree of ¤<<generalization>>¤ of data, that ¤<<spatial fit,Spatial Fit>>¤ (<<__*3.6 Determining Spatial Fit*__>>) be used. For example, the degree to which a record has been ¤<<generalization,generalized>>¤ to obfuscate the ¤<<georeference>>¤ will be a number greater than 1 (see <<Figure 14>> and Chapman 2020).

NOTE: Data should never be <<generalization,generalized>> at the time of collection, when <<georeference,georeferencing>>, or when storing in the database.

Some institutions randomize the data before publishing. This is a practice we do _*NOT*_ recommend, and in fact would discourage it in all circumstances (Chapman 2020).

[[anchor-167]]**Maintaining Data Quality**

Data that have been incorporated into the database and ¤<<georeference,georeferenced>>¤ need to be maintained and checked for ¤<<data quality,quality>>¤. The ¤<<data quality,quality>>¤ checking process involves a number of steps, including receiving feedback from users, providing feedback to collectors, and running various validation tests. For more information on ¤<<data quality>>¤ and what it means for primary species collection data, see Chapman (2005b). Two major principles associated with ¤<<data quality>>¤ and data cleaning are:

* ¤<<error,Error>>¤ prevention is preferable to ¤<<error>>¤ correction.
* The earlier in the information chain that you can detect an ¤<<error>>¤, the cheaper it will be to correct it.

[[anchor-168]]6.1 Feedback to Collectors

Improving the ¤<<data quality,quality>>¤ of the data may require giving feedback to others. For example, if you find that a particular collector is not recording his collection information correctly (_e.g._, not recording the ¤<<datum>>¤ with the ¤<<coordinates,coordinate>>¤ information), then you need to provide feedback so that future records have a lower level of ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ and thus a higher <<data quality, *quality>>*. See the earlier chapter on <<__*Elements for Describing a Location*__>>. Key issues that may require feedback to collectors include:

* Making sure the ¤<<datum>>¤ or ¤<<coordinate reference system>>¤ is recorded with all ¤<<GPS>>¤ readings.
* Encouraging consistent use of a standard ¤<<coordinate format>>¤ (_e.g._, encourage collectors to use ¤<<decimal degrees>>¤ wherever possible).
* Recording ¤<<locality,localities>>¤ in a consistent and clear manner.
** Using the nearest small, persistent ¤<<feature>>¤ and orthogonal ¤<<offset,offsets>>¤.

** Recording ‘by road’ or ‘by air’, being explicit about distance ¤<<precision>>¤, and using specific bearings in degrees for ¤<<offset,offsets>>¤ at a ¤<<heading>>¤.

* [[anchor-169]]Ensure that they document all their processes and methodologies for recording ¤<<locality>>¤ and ¤<<locality>>¤-associated information such as ¤<<elevation>>¤.
* [[anchor-170]]Encourage training in, and the adoption of, best practices such as laid out in this document.

[[anchor-171]]6.2 Accepting Feedback from Users

[[anchor-172]]Feedback from users can be one of the most valuable resources for improving the ¤<<data quality,quality>>¤ of one’s collections and observations. For this to work, however, the institution needs to set up a good feedback mechanism. There needs to be a process whereby all feedback related to ¤<<data quality,quality>>¤ are checked and the results documented (see Chapman 2005a, b). Feedback may be from other institutions holding duplicates of specimens, from users who are carrying out analyses on large amounts of data and find records that are either wrongly ¤<<georeference,georeferenced>>¤, or wrongly identified, or from users who are carrying out ¤<<data quality>>¤ checking on related records. All feedback is important, and should not be ignored. Checks carried out should also always be documented so that the same ‘¤<<error>>¤’ is not checked over and over again, for example, with _*dwc:georeferenceVerificationStatus*_. Having a unique way to reference specimens can be important, and makes feedback much more efficient (see <<__*1.9 Persistent Identifiers (PIDs)*__>>).

[[anchor-173]]6.3 Data Checking and Cleaning

[[anchor-174]]An important but often overlooked aspect to any ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ project is the checking of the ¤<<georeference,georeferenced>>¤ data that goes into the database. This aspect is often ignored because of lack of funds or personnel. However, because the point of any ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ project is to produce ¤<<geographic coordinates>>¤ linking a specimen or observation to a place on a map or to environmental data, it is important that the ¤<<coordinates>>¤ chosen are truly the best ones for the ¤<<location>>¤. Not only does it improve the ¤<<data quality,quality>>¤ of data, but it also identifies trends and habits in ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ that may need to be corrected.

[[anchor-175]]6.3.1 Data Entry

One of the major sources of ¤<<error>>¤ in ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ is at the stage of data entry. ¤<<error,Errors>>¤ can be reduced by the establishment of good data entry procedures – use of pick lists, field constraints, etc. Many of these issues should also be addressed as part of the database design (see <<__*3.1.1.4 Project Follow-up Phase*__>>). Good database design can reduce many of the ¤<<error,errors>>¤ associated with data entry. However, once these are in place and working, then regular checks need to be carried out on the data entry operators and on the process of data entry.

One method developed for the MaPSTeDI project (Murphy _et al_. 2004) is to first check the ¤<<accuracy>>¤ of the ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤. This process involves checking a certain number of each georeferencer's records. Based on various trials, it is recommended that the first 200 records that a new georeferencer completes be checked for ¤<<accuracy>>¤. Not only is this initial checking beneficial to the ¤<<accuracy>>¤ of the data, but also it is essential to allow the georeferencer to improve and learn through feedback from making mistakes. Following is a recommended data quality checking protocol:

* Initial 200 records should be checked. If problems remain, check groups of 100 until satisfied with the georeferencer's abilities.
* Regular checks of 10 randomly selected records for every 100
* If there are more than 2 incorrect records, the quality checker should check 20 more records and can ask the georeferencer to redo the entire 100.
* After a while, the regular checks can be reduced to 5 records for every 100.

[[anchor-176]]The second purpose of ¤<<data quality,quality>>¤ checking is to allow ¤<<georeference,georeferencers>>¤ to refer difficult or confusing records to the ¤<<data quality,quality>>¤ checker for help or advice. The ¤<<data quality,quality>>¤ checker will then resolve these ‘problem records’ as well as possible. Checking problem records can be like detective work. Historical records often have ¤<<locality>>¤ descriptions with ¤<<feature,features>>¤ that do not appear on modern maps or in ¤<<gazetteer,gazetteers>>¤. To find these ¤<<locality,localities>>¤, it is often necessary to consult several different sources of information. These sources include, but are not limited to catalog books, field notes, other records with similar localities, other collections, scientific and other publications, websites, online databases, specialty ¤<<gazetteer,gazetteers>>¤, and historical maps. Bits of information from several places can often be used to establish the correct ¤<<coordinates>>¤ for a historical ¤<<locality>>¤. In addition, some problem records do not make sense because of contradictions or missing or garbled information. These problem records may be the result of mistakes in data entry made in either the paper catalog or the database. It may also be necessary to consult the curatorial staff or even the original collector. If ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ information is able to be found for difficult ¤<<location,locations>>¤, then it is worthwhile documenting them for future use, or even publishing the results of your searches, as seldom are unusual ¤<<locality,localities>>¤ orphans and you, or others, may come across the same ¤<<locality>>¤ again at a later date.

[[anchor-177]]6.3.2 Data Validation

Data validation (checking for ¤<<error,errors>>¤) can be a time-consuming process, however, it is one of the most important processes you can carry out with your data. It is not practical to check every record individually, so the use of batch processing techniques and outlier detection procedures, etc., is essential. Fortunately, a number of these have been developed and are available in software products or online (see http://georeferencing.org[_http://georeferencing.org_] and Chapman (2005b)). The information in those resources are not repeated here. We recommend that you incorporate some of those methodologies into your own working practices.

There are many methods of checking for ¤<<error,errors>>¤ in <<georeference, **georeferenced>> **data. These can involve:

* Using external databases (collectors’ itineraries, ¤<<gazetteer,gazetteers>>¤, etc.).
* Checking against other fields in your own database (making sure the ¤<<georeference>>¤ falls within the correct state, country, region, etc.).
* Using a ¤<<geographic information system,GIS>>¤ to look for records that fall outside polygon boundaries such as bioregions, local government areas, terrestrial/aquatic/marine areas.
* Using statistical methods such as box plots, reverse jackknifing, cumulative frequency curves and cluster analysis to identify outliers in ¤<<latitude>>¤ and ¤<<longitude>>¤ or ¤<<elevation>>¤.
* Using expert-derived range maps.
* Using taxon lists - for example, using a list of marine taxa to determine if a record should be marine or not, and similarly with terrestrial and freshwater aquatic taxa.
* Using modelling software in conjunction with statistical analysis to identify outliers in environmental (_e.g._, climate) space.

Some of these techniques are incorporated into a number of programmes including _BioGeo _(Robertson _et al._ 2016), _CoordinateCleaner_ (Zizka _et al._ 2019) and the stand-alone <geographic information system,*GIS>>* software _DIVA-GIS_ (Hijmans _et al._ 2012). See also http://georeferencing.org[_http://georeferencing.org_].

[[anchor-178]]The Data Quality Interest Group of TDWG established a Task Group in 2014 to develop a set of Core Tests and Assertions for checking and validating the ¤<<data quality,quality>>¤ of species occurrence data (specimens and observation, etc.). The resulting 101 tests based on ¤<<Darwin Core>>¤ terms will be coded and available for use in 2020 (Chapman _et al. 2020_). Currently (as of February 2020), there are 12 Validation tests related to ¤<<coordinates>>¤ and ¤<<datum,datums>>¤ and another seven related to geography. In addition there are seven Amendment tests that can be used to improve the ¤<<data quality,quality>>¤ of the data (https://github.com/tdwg/bdq/labels/Test[_https://github.com/tdwg/bdq/labels/Test_]).

[[anchor-179]]6.3.3 Making Corrections

[[anchor-180]]When making corrections to your database, we strongly recommend that you always add and never replace or delete. For this to happen you will usually require additional fields in the database. For example, you may have ‘original’ or ‘verbatim’ ¤<<georeference>>¤ fields in addition to the main ¤<<georeference>>¤ fields. Additionally, the database may require a number of ‘Remarks/Notes/Comments’ fields. Fields that can be valuable are those that describe validation checking that has been carried out – even (and often especially) if that checking has led to confirmation of the ¤<<georeference>>¤. These fields may include information on what checks were carried out, by whom, when and with what results. Be sure to update the equivalent of _*dwc:georeferenceVerificationStatus*_ and associated fields (_*dwc:georeferencedBy*_, _*dwc:georeferencedDate)*_ whenever changes are made to the ¤<<georeference>>¤_*.*_

[[anchor-181]]6.4 Responsibilities of the Manager

[[anchor-182]]It is important that the manager maintain good sets of documentation (guidelines, best practice documents, etc.), ensure that there are effective feedback mechanisms in place, and ensure that up-to-date ¤<<data quality>>¤ procedures are being implemented. For further responsibilities, we refer you to the document https://doi.org/10.15468/doc.jrgg-a190[_*Principles of Data Quality*_] (Chapman 2005a), which should be read as an adjunct to this document.

[[anchor-183]]6.5 Responsibilities of the Supervisor

[[anchor-184]]The ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ supervisor has the principle responsibility for monitoring and maintaining the ¤<<data quality,quality>>¤ of the data on a day-to-day basis. Perhaps their key responsibility is to supervise the data-entry procedures (see <<__*6.3.1 Data Entry*__>>), and the data validation, checking and cleaning processes. This role is key in any ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ process, along with that of the data entry operators. It is important that the duties and responsibilities be documented in the institution’s best practice manuals and guidelines.

[[anchor-185]]6.6 Training

[[anchor-186]]Training is a major responsibility of anyone beginning or conducting the ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤. Good training can reduce the level of ¤<<error>>¤, reduce costs, and improve ¤<<data quality>>¤.

[[anchor-187]]Topics of a five day course may include (depending on the audience, and not in this order) the following, adapted from Paul (2018):

[[anchor-209]]6.7 Performance Criteria

The development of performance criteria is a good way of ensuring a high level of effectiveness, efficiency, consistency, ¤<<accuracy>>¤, reliability, transparency, and ¤<<data quality,quality>>¤ in the database. Performance criteria can relate to an individual (data entry operator, supervisor, etc.) or to the process as a whole. It can relate to the number of records entered per unit time, but we would recommend that it should relate more to the ¤<<Data quality,quality>>¤ of entry — some ¤<<locality type,locality types>>¤ and some geographic regions are simply more difficult than others. Where possible, performance criteria should be finite and numeric so that performance against the criteria can be documented. Some examples may include

* 90% of records will undergo validation checks within 6 months of entry.
* Any suspect records identified during the validation procedures will be checked and corrected within 30 working days.
* Feedback from users on ¤<<error,errors>>¤ will be checked and the user notified of the results within two weeks.
* All documentation of validation checks will be completed and up-to-date.
* Updated data will be published on a monthly basis.

[[anchor-210]]6.8 Index of Spatial Uncertainty

An Index of Spatial Uncertainty may be developed and documented for the dataset as a whole to allow for overall reporting of the ¤<<data quality,quality>>¤ of the dataset. This index would supplement a similar index of other data in the database, such as an index of Taxonomic Uncertainty and would generally be for internal use, but may be shared as part of an institution's metadata. Currently, no such universal index exists for primary species occurrence data, but institutions may consider developing their own and testing its usefulness. Such indexes should, wherever possible, be generated automatically and produced as part of a data request from the database and packaged with the metadata as part of the request. Such an index could form the basis for helping users determine the ¤<<data quality,quality>>¤ of the database for their particular use. The authors of this document would be interested in any feedback from institutions that develop such an index. The index should form an integral part of the metadata for the dataset and may include the following for the ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ part of the database:

*1. Completeness Index *

* Percentage of records with minimum recommended ¤<<georeference>>¤ fields that have valid values.
* Percentage of records with an ¤<<extent>>¤ field that has a value.
* Percentage of records with an ¤<<uncertainty>>¤ field that has a value.
* Percentage of records with a ¤<<coordinate precision>>¤ field that has a value.
* Percentage of records with ¤<<datum>>¤ fields that have a known ¤<<datum>>¤ or ¤<<coordinate reference system>>¤ value.

*2. Uncertainty Index*

* Average and standard deviation of ‘¤<<uncertainty>>¤’ value for those records that have a value.
* Percentage of records with a ¤<<maximum uncertainty distance>>¤ value in each class:

* a.   <100 m.
b.  100-1,000 m.
c.  1,000-2,000 m.
d.  2,000-5,000 m.
e.  5,000-10,000 m.
f.  >10,000 m.
g.  Not determined.

*3. Currency Index*

* Time since last data entry.
* Time since last validation check.

*4. Validation Index*

* Percentage of records that have undergone validation test *x*.
* Percentage of records that have undergone validation test *y*, etc.
* Percentage of records identified as suspect using validation tests.
* Percentage of suspect records found to be actual ¤<<error,errors>>¤.

[[anchor-211]]The tests arising from the TDWG Data Quality Interest Group include 4 Measure tests at the record level (Chapman__ et al. __2020):

* Number of Validation tests where prerequisites were not met.
* Number of Validation tests that were compliant.
* Number of Validation tests that were not compliant.
* Number of Amendments proposed.

[[anchor-212]]6.9 Documentation

Documentation is one of the key aspects of any ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ process. Documentation involves everything from record-level documentation such as:

* How the ¤<<georeference>>¤ was determined.
* What method was used to determine the ¤<<radial>>¤ and ¤<<uncertainty>>¤.
* What modifications were made (for example, if an operator edits a point on the screen and moves it from point ‘a’ to point ‘b’ it is best practice to document "why" the point was moved and not just record that ¤<<location>>¤ was moved from point ‘a’ to point ‘b’ by the operator).
* Any validation checks that were carried out, by whom and when.
* Flags that may indicate ¤<<uncertainty>>¤, etc.

Documentation also includes the metadata related to the collection as a whole, which may include:

* The overall level of ¤<<data quality>>¤.
* The general checks carried out on the whole dataset.
* The units of measurement and other standards adopted.
* The guidelines followed.

A second set of documentation relates to:

* The institution’s ‘Best Practice’ document which we recommend should be derived from this document and tailored to the specific needs of the institution.
* Training manuals.
* Standard database documentation.
* Guidelines and standards.

We recommend that documentation be made an integral part of any ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ process.

[[anchor-213]]6.9.1 Truth in Labelling

[[anchor-214]]‘Truth in Labelling’ is an important consideration with respect to documenting data ¤<<quality>>¤. This is especially so where data are being made available to a wider audience, for example, through the GBIF. We recommend that documentation of the data and their ¤<<data quality,quality>>¤ be upfront and honest. ¤<<error,Error>>¤ is an inescapable characteristic of any dataset, and it should be recognized as a fundamental attribute of those data. All databases have ¤<<error,errors>>¤, and it is in no-one’s interest to hide those <<error,*errors>> *(Chrisman 1991)*.* On the contrary, revealing data actually exposes them to editing, validation and correction through user feedback, while hiding information almost guarantees that it will remain dirty and of little long-term value.

[[anchor-215]]**Glossary**

The purpose of this glossary is to describe important concepts in accordance with the intended meaning in this document, the associated __*Georeferencing *__Q_*uick Reference Guide*_ (Zermoglio _et al._ 2020) and the __*Georeferencing *__C_*alculator*_ (Wieczorek & Wieczorek 2020). These concepts are treated in broader contexts in many other sources. We have adapted the terms presented here from many sources including Wikipedia (as of November, 2019), the ESRI Dictionary (as of November, 2019) (ESRI _n.dat._), and various articles within Kemp (2008).

¤accuracy¤ — the closeness of an estimated value (for example, measured or computed) to a standard or accepted ("true") value. Antonym: inaccuracy Compare ¤<<error>>¤, ¤<<bias>>¤, ¤<<precision>>¤, ¤<<false precision>>¤ and ¤<<uncertainty>>¤.

NOTE: "__*the true value is not known, but only estimated, the accuracy of the measured quantity is also unknown. Therefore, accuracy of coordinate information can only be estimated.*__**" (Geodetic Survey Division 1996, FGDC 1998).

¤altitude¤ — a measurement of the vertical distance above a ¤<<vertical datum>>¤, usually ¤<<mean sea level>>¤ or ¤<<geoid>>¤. For points on the surface of the earth, altitude is synonymous with ¤<<elevation>>¤.

¤antimeridian¤ — is the ¤<<meridian>>¤ of ¤<<longitude>>¤ opposite a given ¤<<meridian>>¤. A ¤<<meridian>>¤ and its *antimeridian* form a continuous ring around the Earth. The "Antimeridian" is the specific ¤<<meridian>>¤ of ¤<<longitude>>¤ opposite the ¤<<prime meridian>>¤ and is used as the rough basis of the International Date Line.

¤bathymetry¤ — 1) the measure of ¤<<depth>>¤ of water in oceans, seas and lakes. 2) the shapes of underwater terrains, including underwater topography and sea floor mapping.

¤bias¤ — the difference between the average value of a set of measurements and the accepted true value. Bias is equivalent to the average systematic ¤<<error>>¤ in a set of measurements and a correction to negate the systematic ¤<<error>>¤ can be made by adjusting for the bias. Compare ¤<<accuracy>>¤, ¤<<error>>¤, ¤<<precision>>¤, ¤<<false precision>>¤ and ¤<<uncertainty>>¤.

¤boundary¤ — the spatial divide between what is inside a ¤<<location>>¤ and what is outside of it.

¤bounding box¤ — an area defined by the ¤<<coordinates>>¤ of two diagonally opposite corners of a polygon, where those two corners define the north-south and east-west extremes of the area contained within.

¤clause¤ — _see_ <<**locality clause>>. **

¤coordinate format¤ — the format in which ¤<<coordinates>>¤ are encoded, such as "¤<<decimal degrees>>¤", "¤<<DMS,degrees minutes seconds>>¤", "degrees decimal minutes", or ¤<<UTM>>¤.

¤coordinate precision¤ — the fraction of a degree corresponding to the number of significant digits in the source ¤<<coordinates>>¤. For example, if the ¤<<coordinates>>¤ are reported to the nearest minute, the ¤<<precision>>¤ is 1/3600^th^ (0.00027778) of a degree; if a ¤<<decimal degree>>¤ is reported to two decimal places, the ¤<<precision>>¤ is 0.01 of a degree.

¤coordinate reference system¤ — (also ¤<<spatial reference system>>¤) a ¤<<coordinate system>>¤ defined in relation to a standard reference or ¤<<datum>>¤.* *

¤coordinate system¤ — a geometric system that defines the nature and relationship of the ¤<<coordinates>>¤ it uses to uniquely define positions. Examples include the ¤<<geographic coordinate system>>¤ and the ¤<<UTM>>¤ ¤<<coordinate system>>¤.

¤coordinate uncertainty¤ — a measure of the minimum distance on the surface from a ¤<<coordinate>>¤ within which a ¤<<locality>>¤ might be interpreted to be.

¤coordinates¤ — a set of values that define a position within a ¤<<coordinate system>>¤. ¤<<coordinate,Coordinates>>¤ are used to represent ¤<<locations>>¤ in space relative to other ¤<<location,locations>>¤.

¤coordinateUncertaintyInMeters¤ — the ¤<<Darwin Core>>¤ term corresponding to the** <<maximum uncertainty distance>> **when given in meters.

¤corrected center¤ — the point within a ¤<<location>>¤, or on its ¤<<boundary>>¤, that minimizes the ¤<<geographic radial>>¤ of the ¤<<location>>¤. This point is obtained by making the ¤<<smallest enclosing circle>>¤ that contains the entire ¤<<feature>>¤, and then taking the center of that circle. If that center does not fall inside the ¤<<boundary,boundaries>>¤ of the ¤<<feature>>¤, make the ¤<<smallest enclosing circle>>¤ that has its center on the ¤<<boundary>>¤ of the feature. Note that in the second case, the new circle, and hence the ¤<<radial>>¤, will always be larger than the uncorrected one (see <<Figure 4>>).

¤Darwin Core¤ — is a standard for exchanging information about biological diversity (see https://www.tdwg.org/standards/dwc/[_https://www.tdwg.org/standards/dwc/_]).

¤data quality¤ — ‘fitness for use’ of data (Juran 1964, 1995, Chrisman 1991, Chapman 2005a). As the collector of the original data, you may have an intended use for the data you collect but data have the potential to be used in unforeseen ways; therefore, the value of your data is directly related to the fitness of those data for a variety of uses. As data become more accessible, many more uses become apparent (Chapman 2005c).

¤datum¤ — a set of one or more parameters that serve as a reference or basis for the calculation of other parameters [ISO 19111]. A datum defines the position of the origin, the scale, and the orientation of the axes of a ¤<<coordinate system>>¤. For ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ purposes, a *datum* may be a ¤<<geodetic datum>>¤ or a ¤<<vertical datum>>¤.

¤decimal degrees¤ — degrees expressed as a single real number (_e.g._, −22.343456). Note that ¤<<latitude,latitudes>>¤ south of the equator are negative, as are ¤<<longitude,longitudes>>¤ west of the ¤<<prime meridian>>¤ to -180 degrees. See also ¤<<decimal latitude>>¤ and ¤<<decimal longitude>>¤.

¤decimal latitude¤ — <<latitude>> **expressed in ¤<<decimal degrees>>¤. The limits of *decimal latitude* are -90 to 90, inclusive.

¤decimal longitude¤ — <<longitude>> **expressed in ¤<<decimal degrees>>¤. The limits of *decimal longitude* are -180 to 180, inclusive.

¤declination¤ — see __¤<<magnetic declination>>¤.

¤DEM¤ — see_ ¤<<digital elevation model>>¤.

¤depth¤ — a measurement of the vertical distance below a ¤<<vertical datum>>¤. In this document, we try to modify the term to signify the medium in which the measurement is made. Thus, "water depth" is the vertical distance below an air-water interface in a waterbody (ocean, lake, river, sinkhole, etc.). Compare ¤<<distance above surface>>¤. **Depth** is always a non-negative number.

*digital elevation model *(DEM) — a digital representation of the elevation of ¤<<location,locations>>¤ on the surface of the earth, usually represented in the form of a rectangular ¤<<grid>>¤ (raster) that stores the ¤<<elevation>>¤ relative to ¤<<mean sea level>>¤ or some other known ¤<<vertical datum>>¤. The term _Digital Terrain Model_ (DTM) is sometimes used interchangeably with DEM, although it is usually restricted to models representing landscapes. A DTM usually contains additional surface information such as peaks and breaks in slope.

¤direction¤ — see ¤<<heading>>¤.

¤distance above surface¤ — in addition to ¤<<elevation>>¤ and ¤<<depth>>¤, a measurement of the vertical distance above a reference point, with a minimum and a maximum distance to cover a range. For surface terrestrial ¤<<location,locations>>¤, the reference point should be the ¤<<elevation>>¤ at ground level. Over a body of water (ocean, sea, lake, river, glacier, etc.), the reference point for aerial ¤<<location,locations>>¤ should be the ¤<<elevation>>¤ of the air-water interface, while the reference point for sub-surface benthic <location,**locations>> **should be the interface between the water and the substrate. ¤<<location,Locations>>¤ within a water body should use ¤<<depth>>¤ rather than a negative ¤<<distance above surface>>¤. Distances above a reference point should be expressed as positive numbers, while those below should be negative. The maximum distance above a surface will always be a number greater than or equal to the minimum distance above the surface. Since distances below a surface are negative numbers, the maximum distance will always be a number less than or equal to the minimum distance. Compare ¤<<altitude>>¤.

¤DMS¤ — degrees, minutes and seconds - one of the most common formats for expressing ¤<<geographic coordinates>>¤ on maps. A degree is divided into 60 minutes of arc and each minute is divided into 60 seconds of arc. Degrees, minutes and seconds are denoted by the symbols °, ′, ″. Degrees of ¤<<latitude>>¤ are integers between 0 and 90, and should be followed by an indicator for the hemisphere (_e.g._, N or S). Degrees of ¤<<longitude>>¤ are integers between 0 and 180, and should be followed by an indicator for the hemisphere (_e.g._, E or W).

¤easting¤ — within a ¤<<coordinate reference system>>¤ (_e.g._, as provided by a ¤<<GPS>>¤ or a map ¤<<grid>>¤ reference system), the line representing eastward distance from a reference ¤<<meridian>>¤ on a map.

¤elevation¤ — a measurement of the vertical distance of a land or water surface above a ¤<<vertical datum>>¤. On maps, the reference ¤<<datum>>¤ is generally some interpretation of ¤<<mean sea level>>¤ or the ¤<<geoid>>¤, while in devices using ¤<<GPS>>¤/¤<<GNSS>>¤, the reference datum is the ¤<<ellipsoid>>¤ of the ¤<<geodetic datum>>¤ to which the ¤<<GPS>>¤ unit is configured, though the device may make corrections to report the elevation above ¤<<mean sea level>>¤ or the ¤<<geoid>>¤. **Elevations** that are above a reference point should be expressed as positive numbers, while those below should be negative. Compare ¤<<depth>>¤, ¤<<distance above surface>>¤, and ¤<<altitude>>¤.

¤ellipsoid¤ — a three-dimensional, closed geometric ¤<<shape>>¤, all planar sections of which are ellipses or circles. An ellipsoid has three independent axes. If an ellipsoid is made by rotating an ellipse about one of its axes, then two axes of the ellipsoid are the same, and it is called an ellipsoid of revolution. When used to represent a model of the earth, the ellipsoid is an oblate ellipsoid of revolution made by rotating an ellipse about its minor axis.

¤entry point¤ — 🐠 the entry point on the surface of the ocean or lake where a diver enters the water and from which all activities are measured. See <<Figure 7>>.

¤EPSG¤ — EPSG codes are defined by the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers, using a spatial reference identifier (SRID) to reference ¤<<spatial reference system,spatial reference systems>>¤. The EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset (IOPG 2019) is a collection of definitions of ¤<<coordinate reference system,coordinate reference systems>>¤ (including ¤<<datum,datums>>¤) and ¤<<coordinates,coordinate>>¤ transformations which may be global, regional, national or local in application.

¤error¤ — the difference between a computed, estimated, or measured value and the accepted true, specified, or theoretically correct value. It encompasses both the ¤<<precision,imprecision>>¤ of a measurement and its inaccuracies. Error can be either random or systematic. If the ¤<<error>>¤ is systematic, it is called "¤<<bias>>¤". Compare ¤<<accuracy>>¤, ¤<<bias>>¤, ¤<<precision>>¤, ¤<<false precision>>¤ and ¤<<uncertainty>>¤.

¤event¤ — a process occurring at a particular ¤<<location>>¤ during a period of time. Used generically to cover various kinds of collecting events, sampling events, and observations.

¤extent¤ — the entire space within the ¤<<boundary>>¤ a ¤<<location>>¤ actually represents. The extent can be a volume, an area, or a distance.

¤false precision¤ — an artifact of recording data with a greater number of decimal places than implied by the original data. This often occurs following transformations from one unit or ¤<<coordinate system>>¤ to another, for example from feet to meters, or from ¤<<DMS,degrees, minutes, and seconds>>¤ to ¤<<decimal degrees>>¤. In general, ¤<<precision>>¤ cannot be conserved across metric transformations; however, in practice it is often recorded as such. For example, a record of 10°20’ stored in a database in ¤<<decimal degrees>>¤ is ~10.3°. When exported from some databases, it will result in a value of 10.3333333333 with a ¤<<precision>>¤ of 10 decimal places in degrees rather than the original ¤<<precision>>¤ of 1-minute. Misinterpreting the ¤<<precision>>¤ of the ¤<<coordinates,coordinate>>¤ representation as a ¤<<precision>>¤ in distance on the ground, 10^-10^ degrees corresponds to about 0.002 mm at the equator, while the ¤<<precision>>¤ of 1-minute corresponds to about 2.6 km. This is not a true ¤<<precision>>¤ as it relates to the original data, but a ¤<<false precision>>¤ as reported from a combination of the ¤<<coordinates,coordinate>>¤ conversion and the representation of resulting fraction in the export from a database. Compare with ¤<<precision>>¤ and ¤<<accuracy>>¤.

¤feature¤ — an object of observation, measurement, or reference that can be represented spatially. Often categorized into "*feature types*" (_e.g._, mountain, road, populated place, etc.) and given names for specific instances (_e.g._, "Mount Everest", "Ruta 40", "Istanbul"), which are also sometimes referred to as "named places", "place names" or "toponyms".

*footprint* *—*__ see __¤<<shape>>¤. Note that "footprint" was used in some earlier ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ documents and in the ¤<<Darwin Core>>¤ term names __footprintWKT __and _footprintSpatialFit_.

¤gazetteer¤ — an index of geographical ¤<<feature,features>>¤ and their ¤<<location,locations>>¤, often with ¤<<geographic coordinates>>¤.

¤generalization¤ — in geographic terms, refers to the conversion of a geographic representation to one with less resolution and less information content; traditionally associated with a change in scale. Also referred to as: _fuzzying_, _dummying-up_, etc. (Chapman 2020).

¤geocode¤ — the process (verb) or product (noun) of determining the ¤<<coordinates>>¤ for a street address. It is also sometimes used as a synonym for ¤<<georeference>>¤.

¤geodetic coordinate reference system¤ — a ¤<<coordinate reference system>>¤ based on a ¤<<geodetic datum>>¤, used to describe positions on the surface of the earth.

¤geodetic datum¤ — a mathematical model that uses a reference ¤<<ellipsoid>>¤ to describe the size and shape of the surface of the earth and adds to it the information needed for the origin and orientation of ¤<<coordinate system,coordinate systems>>¤ on that surface.

¤geographic boundary¤ — the representation in ¤<<geographic coordinates>>¤ of a vertical projection of a ¤<<boundary>>¤ onto a model of the surface of the earth.

¤geographic center¤ — the midpoint of the extremes of ¤<<latitude>>¤ and ¤<<longitude>>¤ of a ¤<<feature>>¤. *Geographic centers* are relatively easy to determine, but they generally do not correspond to the center obtained by a least circumscribing circle. For that reason it is not recommended to use a *geographic center* for any application in ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤. Compare ¤<<corrected center>>¤.

¤geographic component¤ — the part of a description of a ¤<<location>>¤ that consists of ¤<<geographic coordinates>>¤ and associated ¤<<uncertainty>>¤. Non-geographic components of a ¤<<location>>¤ description include ¤<<elevation>>¤, ¤<<depth>>¤, and ¤<<distance above surface>>¤.

¤geographic coordinate system¤ — a ¤<<coordinate system>>¤ that uses ¤<<geographic coordinates>>¤.

¤geographic coordinate reference system¤ — a ¤<<geodetic coordinate reference system>>¤ that uses ¤<<geographic coordinates>>¤.

¤geographic coordinates¤ — a measurement of a ¤<<location>>¤ on the earth's surface expressed as ¤<<latitude>>¤ and ¤<<longitude>>¤.

¤geographic extent¤ — the entire space within the ¤<<geographic boundary>>¤ of a ¤<<location>>¤. The *geographic extent* can be an area or a distance.

*geographic information system (GIS)* — is a set of computer-based tools designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, map, manage, and present all types of geographical data and information in the form of maps.

¤geographic radial¤ — the distance from the ¤<<corrected center>>¤ of a ¤<<location>>¤ to the furthest point on the ¤<<geographic boundary>>¤ of that ¤<<location>>¤. The geographical radial is what contributes to calculations of the ¤<<maximum uncertainty distance>>¤ using the ¤<<point-radius>>¤ ¤<<georeferencing method>>¤. The term *geographic radial,* as defined here, replaces its equivalent "extent" used in the early versions of these _Best Practices_ and related documents, including the _*Georeferencing Quick Reference Guide*_ (Wieczorek__ et al.__ 2012a) and versions of the _*Georeferencing Calculator*_ (Wieczorek & Wieczorek 2018) and its _*Manual for the Georeferencing Calculator*_ (Wieczorek & Bloom 2015) before 2019, while the new definition of ¤<<extent>>¤ as found in this document remains more in keeping with common usage and understanding and has also been updated in the latest versions of the _*Georeferencing Quick Reference Guide*_ (Zermoglio _et al_. 2020) and the _*Georeferencing Calculator Manual *_(Bloom _et al._ 2020).

¤geoid¤ — a global equipotential surface that approximates ¤<<mean sea level>>¤. This surface is everywhere perpendicular to the force of gravity (Loweth 1997).

¤geometry¤ — the measures and properties of points, lines, and surfaces. **Geometry** is used to represent the ¤<<geographic component>>¤ of ¤<<location,locations>>¤.

¤georeference¤ — the process (verb) or product (noun) of interpreting a ¤<<locality>>¤ description into a spatially mappable representation using a ¤<<georeferencing method>>¤. Compare with ¤<<geocode>>¤. The usage here is distinct from the concept of ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ satellite and other imagery (known as georectification).

¤georeferencing method¤ — the type of spatial representation produced as the output of a ¤<<georeferencing protocol>>¤. In this document we discuss three particular methods of representation in detail, the ¤<<shape>>¤ method, the ¤<<bounding box>>¤ method, and the ¤<<point-radius>>¤ method.

¤georeferencing protocol¤ — the documented specific steps to apply to a ¤<<locality>>¤, based on the ¤<<locality type>>¤, to produce a particular type of spatial representation.

¤GIS¤ — _see_ ¤<<geographic information system (GIS)>>¤.

*Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) —* a 128-bit string of characters applied to one and only one physical or digital entity so that the string uniquely identifies the entity and can be used to refer to the entity. See also ¤<<Persistent Identifier (PID)>>¤.

*GNSS *(Global Navigation Satellite System) — the generic term for satellite navigation systems that provide global autonomous geo-spatial positioning. This term encompasses ¤<<GPS>>¤, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou and other regional systems.

*GPS* (Global Positioning System) — a satellite-based system used for determining positions on or near the earth. Orbiting satellites transmit radio signals that allow a receiver to calculate its own ¤<<location>>¤ as ¤<<coordinates>>¤ and ¤<<elevation>>¤, sometimes with ¤<<accuracy>>¤ estimates. A **GPS** or ¤<<GNSS>>¤ Receiver (including those in smartphones and cameras) is the instrument that receives the radio signals and translates them into ¤<<geographic coordinates>>¤. See also ¤<<GNSS>>¤ of which **GPS** is one example.

*GPS *(receiver) — The colloquial term used to refer to both **GPS** and ¤<<GNSS>>¤ receivers. A *GPS* or ¤<<GNSS>>¤ receiver is an instrument which, in combination with an inbuilt or separate antenna, is able to receive and interpret signals from ¤<<GNSS>>¤ satellites.

¤grid¤ — a network or array of evenly spaced orthogonal lines used to organize space into partitions. Often these are superimposed on a map and used for reference, such as ¤<<UTM>>¤ grid.

¤ground zero¤ — 🐉 the ¤<<location>>¤ on the land surface directly above a radiolocation point in a cave where the magnetic radiation lines are vertical. See <<Figure 10>>.

¤GUID¤ — see __¤<<Globally Unique Identifier (GUID)>>¤_._

¤heading¤ — compass direction such as east or northwest, or sometimes given as degrees clockwise from north. Usually used in conjunction with ¤<<offset>>¤ to give a distance and direction from a ¤<<feature>>¤.

¤height datum¤ — see ¤<<vertical datum>>¤.

¤latitude¤ — the angular distance of a point north or south of the equator.

¤locality¤ — the verbal representation of a ¤<<location>>¤, also sometimes called _**locality** description_.

¤locality clause¤ — a part of a ¤<<locality>>¤ description that can be categorized into one of the ¤<<locality type,locality types>>¤, to which a specific ¤<<georeferencing method>>¤ can be applied.

¤locality type¤ — a category applied to a ¤<<locality clause>>¤ that determines the specific ¤<<georeferencing method>>¤ that should be applied.

¤location¤ — a physical space that can be positioned and oriented relative to a reference point, and potentially described in a natural language ¤<<locality>>¤ description. In ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤, a **location** can have distinct representations based on distinct ¤<<rules of interpretation>>¤, each of which is embodied in a ¤<<georeferencing method>>¤.

¤longitude¤ — the angular distance of a point east or west of a ¤<<prime meridian>>¤ at a given ¤<<latitude>>¤.

*magnetic declination — magnetic declination* is the angle on the horizontal plane between magnetic north (the direction the north end of a magnetized compass needle points, corresponding to the direction of the Earth's magnetic field lines) and true north (the direction along a ¤<<meridian>>¤ towards the geographic North Pole). This angle varies depending on the position on the Earth's surface and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_wandering[chan]ges over time.

¤maximum uncertainty distance¤ — the radius in a ¤<<point-radius>>¤ representation of a ¤<<location>>¤, that is a numerical value that defines the upper limit of the horizontal distance from the position of the given ¤<<geographic coordinate>>¤ to a point on the outer extremity of the geographic area within which the whole of a ¤<<location>>¤ lies. When given in meters, it corresponds to the ¤<<Darwin Core>>¤ term _*coordinateUncertaintyInMeters*_.

*mean sea level (MSL) —* a ¤<<vertical datum>>¤ from which heights such as ¤<<elevation>>¤ are usually measured. *Mean sea levels* were traditionally determined locally by measuring the midpoint between a mean low and mean high tide at a particular ¤<<location>>¤ averaged over a 19-year period covering a complete tidal cycle. More recently, *mean sea level* is best described by a ¤<<geoid>>¤.

¤meridian¤ — a line on the surface of the earth where all of the ¤<<location,locations>>¤ have the same ¤<<longitude>>¤. Compare ¤<<antimeridian>>¤ and¤<< prime meridian>>¤.

¤named place¤ — _see_ <<*feature>>*. Note that "named place" was used in some earlier ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ documents.

¤northing¤ — within a ¤<<coordinate reference system>>¤ (_e.g._, as provided by a ¤<<GPS>>¤ or a map ¤<<grid>>¤ reference system), the line representing northward distance from a reference ¤<<latitude>>¤.

¤offset¤ — a displacement from a reference ¤<<location>>¤. Usually used in conjunction with ¤<<heading>>¤ to give a distance and ¤<<direction>>¤ from a ¤<<feature>>¤.

¤path¤ — a route or track between one place and another. In some cases the path may cross itself.

*Persistent Identifier (PID) —* is a long-lasting reference to a document, file, web page, or other object. The term "persistent identifier" is usually used in the context of digital objects that are accessible over the Internet. There are many options for PIDs, such as <<Globally Unique Identifier (GUID),*Globally Unique Identifiers* (*GUIDs*)>>, Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs), and Universal Unique Identifiers (UUIDs).

¤point-radius¤ — a representation of the ¤<<geographic component>>¤ of a ¤<<location>>¤ as a ¤<<geographic coordinate>>¤ and a ¤<<maximum uncertainty distance>>¤. The ¤<<point-radius>>¤ ¤<<georeferencing method>>¤ produces ¤<<georeference,georeferences>>¤ that include ¤<<geographic coordinates>>¤, a ¤<<coordinate reference system>>¤, and a ¤<<maximum uncertainty distance>>¤ that encompasses all of the possible ¤<<geographic coordinates>>¤ where a ¤<<locality>>¤ might be interpreted to be. This representation encompasses all of the geographical ¤<<uncertainty,uncertainties>>¤ within a circle. The point-radius method uses ranges to represent the non-geographic descriptors of the location (¤<<elevation>>¤, ¤<<depth>>¤, ¤<<distance above surface>>¤).

¤precision¤ — 1) the closeness of a repeated set of observations of the same quantity to one another - a measure of control over random ¤<<error>>¤. 2) With values, it describes the finest unit of measurement used to express that value (_e.g._, if a record is reported to the nearest second, the precision is 1/3600^th^ of a degree; if a ¤<<decimal degrees,decimal degree>>¤ is reported to two decimal places, the precision is 0.01 of a degree). Antonym: imprecise. Compare ¤<<accuracy>>¤, ¤<<error>>¤, ¤<<bias>>¤, ¤<<false precision>>¤, and ¤<<uncertainty>>¤.

¤prime meridian¤ — the set of ¤<<location,locations>>¤ with ¤<<longitude>>¤ designated as 0 degrees east and west, to which all other ¤<<longitude,longitudes>>¤ are referenced.

¤projection¤ — a series of transformations that convert the locations of points in a ¤<<coordinate reference system>>¤ on a curved surface (the reference surface or ¤<<datum>>¤) to the ¤<<location,locations>>¤ of corresponding points in a ¤<<coordinate reference system>>¤ on a flat plane. The ¤<<datum>>¤ is an integral part of the projection, as projected ¤<<coordinate system,coordinate systems>>¤ are based on ¤<<geographic coordinates>>¤, which are in turn referenced to a ¤<<geodetic datum>>¤. It is possible, and even common for datasets to be in the same *projection*, but referenced to distinct ¤<<geodetic datum,geodetic datums>>¤, and therefore have different ¤<<coordinate>>¤ values.

¤quality¤ — _see_ ¤<<data quality>>¤.

¤radial¤ — the distance from a center point (_e.g._, the ¤<<corrected center,corrected>>¤ or ¤<<geographic center>>¤) within a ¤<<location>>¤ to the furthest point on the outermost ¤<<boundary>>¤ of that ¤<<location>>¤. See also ¤<<geographic radial>>¤.

*repatriate* or ¤repatriation¤ — the process of returning something to the source from which it was extracted. In the ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ sense, this refers to the process of adding the results of ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ to the original data, especially when ¤<<georeference,georeferencing>>¤ was done by a third party.

¤rules of interpretation¤ — a documented set of steps to take in order to produce a standardized representation of source information.

*SBAS *(Satellite Based Augmentation System) — is a civil aviation safety-critical system that supports wide-area or regional augmentation through the use of geostationary (GEO) satellites that broadcast the augmentation information (see discussion in section <<__*2.6.4 Satellite Based Augmentation System*__>>).

¤shape¤ — synonym of ¤<<footprint>>¤. A representation of the ¤<<geographic component>>¤ of a ¤location¤ as a ¤<<geometry>>¤. The result of a <<**shape** *georeferencing method>>* includes a shape as the ¤<<geographic component>>¤ of the ¤<<georeference>>¤, which contains the set of all possible ¤<<geographic coordinates>>¤ where a ¤<<location>>¤ might be interpreted to be. This representation encompasses all of the geographical ¤<<uncertainties>>¤ within the ¤<<geometry>>¤ given. The *shape* ¤<<georeferencing method,method>>¤ uses ranges to represent the non-geographic descriptors of the ¤<<location>>¤ (¤<<elevation>>¤, ¤<<water depth>>¤, <¤<<distance above surface>>¤).

¤smallest enclosing circle¤ — a circle with the smallest radius (¤<<radial>>¤) that contains all of a given set of points (or a given ¤<<shape>>¤) on a surface (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallest-circle_problem[_https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallest-circle_problem_]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallest-circle_problem[)]. This is seldom the same as the ¤<<geographic center>>¤, nor the midpoint between two most distant ¤<<geographic coordinates>>¤ of a ¤<<location>>¤.

¤spatial fit¤ — a measure of how well one geometric representation matches another geometric representation as a ratio of the area of the larger of the two to the area of the smaller one. (See <<Figure 14>>).

¤spatial reference system¤ — __see__ ¤<<coordinate reference system>>¤.* *

¤stratigraphic section¤ — a local outcrop or series of adjacent outcrops that display a vertical sequence of strata in the order they were deposited.

¤transect¤ — a ¤<<path>>¤ along which observations, measurements, or samples are made. Transects are often recorded as a starting ¤<<location>>¤ and a terminating ¤<<location>>¤.

¤trig point¤ — a surveyed reference point, often on high points of ¤<<elevation>>¤ (mountain tops, etc.) and usually designated with a fixed marker on a small pyramidal structure or a pillar. The exact ¤<<location>>¤ is determined by survey triangulation and hence the alternative names "trigonometrical point", "triangulation point" or "benchmark".

¤uncertainty¤ — a measure of the incompleteness of one’s knowledge or information about an unknown quantity whose true value could be established if complete knowledge and a perfect measuring device were available (Cullen & Frey 1999). ¤<<georeferencing method,georeferencing methods>>¤ codify how to incorporate uncertainties from a variety of sources (including ¤<<accuracy>>¤ and ¤<<precision>>¤) in the interpretation of a ¤<<location>>¤. Compare ¤<<accuracy>>¤, ¤<<error>>¤, ¤<<bias>>¤, ¤<<precision>>¤, and ¤<<false precision>>¤.

*UTM* (Universal Transverse Mercator) — a standardized ¤<<coordinate system>>¤ based on a metric rectangular ¤<<grid>>¤ system and a division of the earth into sixty 6-degree longitudinal zones. The scope of **UTM** covers from 84° N to 80° S. (See <<__*2.4.2 Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM> Coordinates*__>>).

¤vertical datum¤ — (also ¤<<height datum>>¤) is a reference surface for vertical positions, such as ¤<<elevation>>¤. *Vertical datums* fall into several categories, including: tidal, based on sea level; gravimetric, based on a ¤<<geoid>>¤; geodetic, based on ¤<<ellipsoid>>¤ models of the Earth; or local, based on a local reference surface.

*WAAS *(Wide Area Augmentation System) — is an air navigation aid developed by the US Federal Aviation Administration to augment the Global Positioning System (¤<<GPS>>¤), with the goal of improving its ¤<<accuracy>>¤, integrity, and availability. See also ¤<<SBAS>>¤ of which *WAAS* is one example.

*WGS84* (World Geodetic System 1984) — a popular globally-used horizontal ¤<<geodetic coordinate reference system>>¤ (epsg:4326) upon which raw ¤<<GPS>>¤ measurements are based (though a ¤<<GPS>>¤ receiver is capable of delivering ¤<<coordinates>>¤ in other ¤<<reference systems>>¤). The term is also commonly used for the ¤<<geodetic datum>>¤ used by that system and for the ¤<<ellipsoid>>¤ (epsg:7030) upon which that ¤<<datum>>¤ (epsg:6326) is based.

Many people have contributed ideas to this document and its precursors, either directly or indirectly through discussions at meetings, publications, or in email correspondence. We refer you to the earlier document for those we acknowledged there.

[[anchor-217]]The people we would like to particularly acknowledge for this document, include Paula F. Zermoglio, David Bloom, Deborah Paul, Nelson Rios, Lee Belbin, Paul J. Morris, Alex Thompson, Ward Appeltens, Sarah Gilbert, Robert Kershaw, Arturo H. Ariño, Arnald Marcer, Dimitris Koureas and members of the TDWG Data Quality Interest Group, Task Group 2 as well as staff at the GBIF Secretariat, especially Laura Russell, Kyle Copas, and Matt Blissett who provided support for the project. Members of the Paleo community, especially Talia Karim and Jessica Bazeley, provided valuable feedback on topics of particular interest to that community. Special mention must be made of Alejandro Tablado for "complaining" in the GBIF Georeferencing Workshop in Buenos Aires in 2006 about the lack of treatment of marine considerations in the first version of the Best Practices Guide. The suggestion was much appreciated. We hope that the current document makes up for our lack of attention to the topic in the earlier version.
